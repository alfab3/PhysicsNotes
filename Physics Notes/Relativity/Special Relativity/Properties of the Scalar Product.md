## Basics: 

$$\begin{gather} xy = yx \\ (\alpha x + \beta y)z = \alpha xz + \beta yz & (\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb R) \end{gather}$$

## Orthogonality
Scalar (dot) product: 
$$\begin{gather} xy = x_\mu y^\mu = 0\end{gather}$$
Light vectors are orthogonal to themselves

Sum and difference vectors of light-like vectors are orthogonal

$$\begin{gather} x^2 = y^2 = 0 (x \neq y)\\ \Rightarrow (x+y)(x-y) = x^2-y^2=0\end{gather}$$

If two light-like vectors are orthogonal they must be proportional
