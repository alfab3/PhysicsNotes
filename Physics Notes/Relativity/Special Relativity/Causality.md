There exists a framework to parameterize causality with the following equation:

$$\begin{gather} \Delta s^2 = (c\Delta t)^2 -\Delta x^2 - \Delta y^2 - \Delta z^2 \end{gather}$$


If: $\Delta s^2 < 0$ : events cannot be causally connected, there exists a frame where they are simultaneous

If: $\Delta s^2 > 0$: the two events can be causally connected, there exists a frame in which they are at same position
