Reconcile the constancy of $c$ [[Speed of Light]] across inertial frames with space-time coordinate transformations.

Embedded in the structure of Maxwell's which are not invariant under Galilean transformations

Space and time are no longer independent.

Consider a light signal propagating from the origin of reference system $\{\vec x,t\}$ at velocity $c$, starting at time $t = 0$ 

At time t the sphere in $4D$ takes the form:

$$\begin{gather} x^2+y^2+z^2 = (ct)^2\\ (ct)^2 - x^2-y^2 -z^2 = 0\end{gather}$$

Consider another inertial reference frame $\{\vec x', t'\}$ that coincides with $\{x,t\}$ at t = t' = 0. Light propagates at velocity $c$ in $\{x'\}$: 

$$\begin{gather} (ct')^2-x'^2-y'^2-z'^2 = 0 \end{gather}$$
Define $x_0 = ct$:

$$\begin{gather}x_0^2 - \vec x^2 = 0\Leftrightarrow x _0^2\ ' - \vec x^2\ ' = 0 \end{gather}$$
The light-like relationship between time and space coordinates defines the Lorentz transformation
