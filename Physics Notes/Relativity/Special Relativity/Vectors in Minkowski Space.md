Different cases: 

$$\begin{gather} x ^2\begin{cases} > 0 & \text{time-like} \\ = 0 & \text{light-like} \\ < 0 & \text{space-like} \end{cases}\end{gather}$$
Light cone: for an observer at $(t=0, \vec x = 0)$ vertex of the cone, it represents a spherical light wave coming from $- \infty$ and collapsing on the origin and expanding to $+\infty$ in the future

In this 2D representation (c=1) and creates a 45$\degree$ 

The slope between two points = inverse of the velocity of a signal between them

Slope $>1 \Rightarrow$ Causal
Slope $< 1 \Rightarrow$ space-like
