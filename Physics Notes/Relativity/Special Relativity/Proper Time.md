Consider an object with mass in its rest frame 

$\lambda = \tau \to$ proper time

the time measured by the clock at rest with the object $\to$ preferred time (always the slowest)

Consider $x^\mu(\lambda)$ 

$$\begin{gather} \frac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda} \end{gather}$$ is a vector. 

For a given $\lambda = \bar{\lambda}$: $\bar{x}^\mu \equiv x^\mu(\bar{\lambda})$ 

$$\begin{gather} \lambda = \bar{\lambda} + d\lambda \to x^\mu (\bar{\lambda}+d\lambda) = \bar{x}^\mu+dx^\mu \end{gather}$$

$\lambda = \tau: \frac{dx_\mu}{d\tau} \frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau} = 1$
