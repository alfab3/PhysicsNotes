The path followed by an object in space-time ![[world line.png]]

Where $x(t)$ is the implicit equation, world line w.r.t. a specific choice of the clock: $t$

Note: for a physical object, the slope of the world line, $\frac{dx}{dt}$, is always $\geq 1$ (time or light like) 

world lines do not have to go through the origin of a given coordinate system.

$x_2(t)$ is ahead of $x_1(t)$ (time translation)

$x_3(t)$ is displaced from $x_1(t)$ (space translation)

### Parameterize
is there a natural time scale?
$$\begin{gather} x^\mu(\lambda) \end{gather}$$

There exists infinite parameterizations of a world line

$\lambda$ is the dummy integration parameter

The measured time in $\{x\}$ is the path integral of the instantaneous proper time

$$\begin{gather} \frac{dt}{d\tau} = \gamma \Rightarrow t_2 - t_1 = \int^{\tau_2}_{\tau_1} d\tau' \gamma(\tau') \end{gather}$$
