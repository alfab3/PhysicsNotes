Let's say we have two [[Vectors]] $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$.  To add these two [[Vectors]], you place the tail of one vector at the tip of the other vector and draw a new vector between the tail and tip of the two vectors. That new vector is their sum i.e. $\vec{v} + \vec{w}$. Numerically, if we have two vectors and sum them:
$$\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1\\
    2
    \end{bmatrix}
    +
    \begin{bmatrix}
    3\\
    -1
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    4\\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}$$
The other version of arithmetic is multiplication by a number: for example: $2\vec{v}$ means you double the vectors magnitude. This process is called scaling. This is why non-vector values are referred to as a scalar. Numerically:
$$\begin{align}
    2 \cdot
    \begin{bmatrix}
    3\\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    6\\
    2
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}$$
