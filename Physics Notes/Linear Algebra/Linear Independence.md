We say a vector is linearly independent of another set of vectors if the former can not be written as a linear combination of the latter. Say we have $\ket{\phi_1}, ... \ket{\phi_r}$ are linearly independent if the equation $a\ket{\phi_1} + ... + a_r \ket{\phi_r} = 0$ implies that $a_1 = 0 = a_2 = ... = a_r$ then this set of vectors is linearly independent.
