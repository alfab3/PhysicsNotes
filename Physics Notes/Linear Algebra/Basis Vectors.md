If you have a vector:
$$\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    3\\
    -2
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}$$
And we think of each coordinate as a scalar. Meaning think about how each stretches or squishes a vector. In the x-y plane, there are two important vectors, one pointing along the positive x-axis with length one, known as $\hat{i}$ and one pointing along the positive y-axis with length one, known as $\hat{j}$ the $x$ coordinate scales $\hat{i}$ while the $y$ coordinate scales $\hat{j}$. The vector that these coordinates describe are the sum of two scaled vectors: $3\hat{i} - 2\hat{j}$. The $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ vector are called the [[Basis Vectors]] of the $xy$ coordinate system. Which means when you think about coordinates as scalars the [[Basis Vectors]] are what are scaled. Any time your adding two [[vectors]] and scaling them like this its called a [[Linear Combination]]:
$$\begin{equation}
    a\vec{v}+b\vec{w}
\end{equation}$$

In 3D space the basis vectors take the form: $$\hat{i} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
        1\\
        0\\
		0
\end{bmatrix}$$

$$\hat{j} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
        0\\
        1\\
		0
\end{bmatrix}$$

$$\hat{k} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
        0\\
        0\\
		1
\end{bmatrix}$$
