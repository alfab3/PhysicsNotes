The set of all possible outputs $A\vec{v}$ is called the "Column space" of $A$. The column's of the matrix tell you where your basis vector is going to land. The [[span]] of those transformed [[vectors]] tell you where all the [[vectors]] are going to land. In other words the column space is the span of the columns of your matrix. The zero vector: 
$$\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0\\
        0
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}$$
Is always in the column space. There is a whole line of vectors when space gets squished to a smaller dimension that lands on the origin. This is called the null space or kernel.
