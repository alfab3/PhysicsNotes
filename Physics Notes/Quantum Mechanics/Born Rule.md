# Definition
A key postulate of [[Quantum Mechanics]] which gives the probability that a measurement of a [[Quantum System]] will yield a given result. In its simplest form, it states that the [[Probability Density]] of finding a particle at a given point when measured is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the particle's [[Wavefunction]] at that point.
