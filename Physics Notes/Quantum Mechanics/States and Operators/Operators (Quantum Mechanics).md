Operators operate on vectors and return another vector. All operators may be described in terms of bras and kets as a [[Linear Combination]] of [[Outer Product]]s

$$\begin{gather} \mathcal A = \sum_{ij} a_{ij}\ket{i}\bra{j} \end{gather}$$

Operators can also be represented as a matrix, with an [[Orthonormal Basis]]. The matrix and the coefficients are synonymous $A_{ij} = a_{ij}$. Otherwise one can express the states $\ket{i}$ and $\ket{j}$ as vectors, $v(i)_m$ and $v(j)_n$: 

$$\begin{gather} A_{mn} = \sum_{ij} a_{ij}v(i)_m v^*(j)_n \end{gather}$$

where $v(i)_m$ is the $m^{th}$ component of the [[Basis Vectors]] $v(i)$.
