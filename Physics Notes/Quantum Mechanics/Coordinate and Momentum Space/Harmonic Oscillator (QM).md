One of the most common problems in physics is the harmonic oscillator. In fact, quantum field theory considers every point in space to have its own oscillators for every type of quantum field. We begin with a single oscillator with the Hamiltonian
$$\begin{gather} H = \frac{\mathcal P^2}{2m}+\frac{m\omega^2}{2}\mathcal X^2 \end{gather}$$
where the spring constant is expressed in terms of a [[Frequency]] $\omega,k=m\omega^2$. Here, $\mathcal X$ and $\mathcal P$ are operators. 

Dirac's solution solution to the problem involves first defining two new operators $$\begin{gather} a \equiv \sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{2\hbar}}\mathcal X + i\sqrt{\frac{1}{2\hbar m\omega}}\mathcal P, \; a^\dagger = \sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{2\hbar}}\mathcal X - i\sqrt{\frac{1}{2\hbar m \omega}}\mathcal P \end{gather}$$
The operators are known as the annihilation (or destruction) and creation operators respectively ([[Creation and Annihilation Operators]]) for reasons to be seen below. In some texts, these operators are referred to as ladder operators. 

The operators satisfy simple commutation relations,

$$\begin{gather} [a,a^\dagger] = 1 \end{gather}$$
Then the [[Hamiltonian]] can be written as:
$$\begin{gather} H = \hbar \omega\left(a^\dagger a + \frac{1}{2}\right) \end{gather}$$
