$\ket{\phi_n}\bra{\phi_n}$ is a projection operator. In some familiar notation say we have: 
$$\vec{v} = v_1\hat{i} + v_2\hat{j} + v_3\hat{k}$$ 

In general terms:
$$\ket{\psi} = v_1\ket{\phi_1} + v_2\ket{\phi_2} + v_3\ket{\phi_3}$$

We have: $\braket{\phi_1 | \psi} = v_1$, but if you want to produce the whole thing with the $\ket{\phi_1}$
$$\ket{\phi_1}\braket{\phi_1|\psi} = \ket{\phi_1}v_1 = v_1\ket{\phi_1}$$
 Where $\ket{\phi_1} \bra{\phi_1}$ is the projection operator. Originally they would use: $\hat{i} \hat{i} \cdot \vec{v} = v_1\hat{i}$ which used to be called the dyadic. 
 Properties:
 $$p_n = \ket{\phi_n} \bra{\phi_n}$$
 $$p_n^2 = \ket{\phi_n} \braket{\phi_n | \phi_n} \bra{\phi_n} = \ket{\phi_n} \bra{\phi_n} = p_n$$.
 
 If you have an orthonormal basis formed from these vectors? 
 $$\sum_n \ket{\phi_n} \bra{\phi_n} = \mathbb{I}$$ 
 Which is the unit operator, the unit operator, when acting ona  vector, does nothing at all. 
 
 $$p_n(p_n - \mathbb{I}) = 0$$
 
 [[Eigenvalues]] of projection operators are either 0 or 1.
