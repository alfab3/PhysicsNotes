[[Electric Field]]s and [[Magnetic Field]]s are determined by the vector potential $\vec A$ and the scalar potential $\Phi$ 

$$\begin{gather} \vec E = - \nabla \Phi - \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial \vec A}{\partial t}, & \vec B = \nabla \times\vec A \end{gather}$$
The units of $e\Phi$ and $e\vec A$ are both energy ([[Classical Mechanics/Conservation Laws/Energy]]). This is consistent with cgs units
