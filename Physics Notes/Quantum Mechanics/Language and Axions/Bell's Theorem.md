Suppose [[Hidden Variables]] do exist and consider the implications of this assumption for the state of: 

$$\begin{gather} \ket{\psi_0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{\uparrow}\ket{\downarrow}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{\uparrow}\ket{\downarrow} \end{gather}$$

Let $\xi$ be the set of all relevant local hidden variables that unambiguously define the projections $A^{(I)}_\xi(\hat a)$ and $A^{(2)}_\xi$ of (respectively) the first and second spin on the axis of the unit vector $\hat a$.
