In classical mechanics the statistical description and the full dynamical description naturally deal with distinctively different mathematical objects. The dynamical description - the canonical formalism - operates with canonical dynamical variables (i.e. [[Generalized Coordinates]] and momenta), while the statistical description is all about the distribution functions for the canonical variables. In Quantum Mechanics - thanks to its probabilistic nature and linearity  - the statistical description operates with the very same object, the [[Density Matrix]] - often referred to, in this context as [[Statistical Operator]]. The only difference is that in the dynamic theory one normally addresses the density matrix of the full system, while quantum statistics is naturally constructed in terms of the [[Reduced Density Matrices]]. In the quantum statistical context the reduced density matrix $\hat \rho^{(I)}$ describes either a smaller subsystem of a macroscopic system, or a system weakly coupled to a [[Heat Bath]]. In the case of equilibrium statistics considered below, both cases are essentially equivalent, since a smaller subsystem of a macroscopic system can be viewed as a part of a bigger subsystem, the latter being weakly coupled to a heat bath effectively replacing the rest of the macroscopic system. For example, in the case of ideal Bose or Fermi gases these subsystems are nothing but single-particle eigenmodes.
