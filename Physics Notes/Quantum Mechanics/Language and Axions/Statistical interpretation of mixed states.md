Consistent with the [[Measurement Postulate]], any mixed state $\hat \rho$ can interpreted as a statistical mixture of (equivalently, a random choice out of) special sets of pure states. Namely a random choice with probability $w_j$ of one of the pure states $\{|\psi_j|\}$, corresponding to the [[Eigenvectors]] of the density matrix: 
$$\begin{gather}\hat \rho \ket{\psi_j} = w_j\ket{\psi_j} \end{gather}$$

The interpretation is based on the representation 
$$\begin{gather} \hat \rho = \sum_j w_j\ket{\psi_j}\bra{\psi_j} & \braket{\psi_{j_1}|\psi_{j_2}} = \delta_{j_1j_2}\end{gather}$$

along with the properties $w_j\geq 0, \sum_jw_j=1$, allowing one to interpret $w_j$ as probabilities.
