## Definition
In quantum mechanics, a Density matrix is a matrix that describes the [[Quantum State]] of a physical system. It allows for the calculation of the probabilities of the outcomes of any measurement using the [[Born Rule]]. It is a generalization of the more usual [[State Vector]] or [[Wavefunction]]s: while those can only represent [[Pure State]]s, density matrices can also represent [[Mixed States]]. Mixed states arise in quantum mechanics in two different situations: first when the preparation of the system is not fully known, and thus one must deal with a [[Statistical Ensemble]] of a possible preparations, and second when one wants to describe a system that is entangled ([[Quantum Entanglement]]) with another, as its state can not be described by a pure state.
