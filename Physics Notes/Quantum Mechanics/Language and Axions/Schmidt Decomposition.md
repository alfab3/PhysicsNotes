Consider a system split into two subsystems, $I$ and $II$. With a general choice of ONBs [[Orthonormal Basis]] in the [[Hilbert Space]]s of the subsystems $I$ and $II$, an expansion of any pure state $\ket{\psi}$ of our system has the generic form: 

$$\begin{gather}\ket{\psi} = \sum_{nm} c_{nm} \ket{e_{nm}} = \sum_{nm}c_{nm}\ket{e_n^{(I)}}\ket{e_m^{(II)}} \end{gather}$$

There is, however, a very special choice of orthonormal sets of vectors in two subsystems, $\{\ket{\phi_n^{(I)}}\}$ and $\{\ket{\phi_n^{(II)}}\}$ dictated by particular form of the pure state $\ket{\psi}$. With this special choice one has 

$$\begin{gather} \ket{\psi} = \sum_na_n\ket{\psi^{(I)}_n}\ket{\psi^{(II)}_n} \end{gather}$$
In mathematics the representation is known as Schmidt decomposition.
