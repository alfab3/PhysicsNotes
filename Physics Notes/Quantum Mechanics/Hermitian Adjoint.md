This called the [[Hermitian Adjoint]]. So this maps a vector $\ket{x}$ to a linear operator on vectors, i.e. a covector. This map is anti-linear $(\ket{x} + \lambda\ket{y})^\dagger = \ket{x}^\dagger +\lambda^\dagger\ket{y}^\dagger$ 
It is possible to show that for finite-dimensional $V$ the map is $1-1$

This implies that, once we define an inner product on a vector field $V$, we have a natural (and antilinear) identification of $V\leftarrow \rightarrow V^*$
