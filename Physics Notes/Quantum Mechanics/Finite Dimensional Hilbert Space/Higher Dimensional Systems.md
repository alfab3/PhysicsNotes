The general approach to an arbitrary $n$-dimensional system is along the same lines as for $n=2$. In a certain ONB $\{\ket{e_s}\}$ , the Hamiltonian operator is represented by the $n \times n$ Hermitian matrix. To solve the general evolution problem, one has to diagonalize this matrix (find its [[Eigenvalues]] and [[Eigenvectors]]):

$$\begin{gather} \hat H \ket{\phi_k} = E_k\ket{\phi_k} &&& (k=1,2,3,\ldots, n) \end{gather}$$
The dynamics of generic wave function $\ket{\psi}$ is then represented as 



$$\begin{gather} \ket{\psi(t)} = \sum^n_{k=1}\braket{\phi_k|\psi(0)}e^{-iE_kt}\ket{\phi_k} \end{gather}$$

From this equation we see that generic periodicity of the solution takes place only at $n=2$. At $n > 2$, the periodicity requires that all the spacings between the [[Eigenenergies]] in the expansion be commensurate with each other. While not being totally exotic, the condition of commensurability of energy spacings is very special.
