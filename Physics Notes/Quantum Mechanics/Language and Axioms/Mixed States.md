A mixed [[Quantum State]] is a [[Statistical Ensemble]] of [[Pure State]]s. Mixed states inevitably arise from pure states when for a composite quantum system $H_1 
\otimes H_2$ with an [[Entangled State]] on it, the part $H_2$ is inaccessible to the observer. The state of the part $H_1$ is expressed then as the partial trace over $H_2$.

A mixed state cannot be described with a single ket vector. Instead, it is described by its associated [[Density Matrix]] (or density operator), usually denoted $\rho$. Note that density matrices can describe both mixed and pure states, treating them on the same footing. Moreover, a mixed quantum state on a given quantum system described by a [[Hilbert Space]] $H$ can be always represented as the partial trace of a pure quantum state on a larger bipartite system for a sufficiently large Hilbert space.

The density matrix describing a mixed state is defined to be an operator of the form 
$$\begin{gather} \rho = \sum_sp_s\ket{\psi_s}\bra{\psi_s} \end{gather}$$
