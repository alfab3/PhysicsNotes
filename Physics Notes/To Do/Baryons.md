# Description
A type of composite [[Subatomic Particles]] which contains an odd number of valence [[Quarks]] (at least 3). Baryons belong to the [[Hadrons]] family of particles, Baryons are also classified as [[Fermion]]s because they have half-integer [[Spin]].

Baryons participate in the [[Strong Interaction]], which is mediated by [[Gluons]].

Some Baryons include: [[Protons]] and [[Neutrons]], but not [[Electrons]] which is a different family of particles known as [[Leptons]].

Exotic Baryons containing five quarks known as pentaquarks have also been discovered and studied.
