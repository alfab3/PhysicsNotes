Quark Matter (also known as QCD matter) refers to any of a number of hypothetical phases phases of matter whose degrees of freedom include [[Quarks]] and [[Gluons]], of which prominent example is quark-gluon plasma.

Quarks are liberated into quark matter at extremely high temperatures and/or densities, and some of them are still only theoretical.
