## Definition
Bethe formula or Bethe-Bloch formula (pronounced "Beta") describes the mean energy loss per distance traveled of swift [[Charged Particles]] traversing matter (or alternatively the stopping power of the material). For electrons the energy loss is slightly different due to their small mass and indistinguishability, and since they suffer much larger losses by [[Bremsstrahlung]], terms must be added to account for this. Fast charged particles moving through matter interact with the electrons of atoms in the material. This interaction excites or ionizes the atoms, leading to an energy loss of the traveling particle.

## Formula
For a particle with speed $v$, charge $z$ (in multiples of the electron charge), and energy $E$, traveling a distance $x$ into a target of electron number density $n$ and mean excitation potential $I$, the relativistic version of the formula reads, in SI units: 

$$\begin{gather}-\left<\frac{dE}{dx}\right> = \frac{4\pi}{m_ec^2}\frac{nz^2}{\beta^2}\left(\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\right)^2 \left[\ln\left(\frac{2m_ec^2 \beta^2}{I\cdot(1-\beta^2)}\right)-\beta^2\right]\end{gather}$$

Where $c$ is the [[Speed of Light]] and $\epsilon_0$ is the [[Permitivity of vacuum]], $\beta = \frac{v}{c}$, $e$ and $m_e$ the electron charge and rest mass respectively.

Here the electron density of the material can be calculated by 

$$\begin{gather} n = \frac{N_A \cdot Z \cdot \rho}{A\cdot M_u}\end{gather}$$ 

where $\rho$ is the density of the material, Z its [[Atomic Number]], A its relative [[Atomic Mass]], $N_A$ the [[Avogadro's Number]] and $M_u$ the Molar mass constant.
