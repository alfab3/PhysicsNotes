Suppose we have a smooth line $\mathcal{L}$ in the smooth surface $S$, passing through two given points, $(x_a, y_a, z_a)$ and $(x_b, y_b, z_b)$. Let the surface $S$ and the line $\mathcal{L}$ be specified by the equations 
$$
z = s(x,y)
$$
which is the surface
$$
y= f(x), \;\;\;\; z = s(x,f(x))
$$
Let us show that the length of the line is the [[functional]] of the form $F[f] = \int^{x_b}_{x_a} g(f,f_x,x)dx$. Introducing convenient notation:
$$
s_x = \frac{\partial s(x,y)}{\partial x}, \;\;\; s_y = \frac{\partial s(x,y)}{\partial y}
$$
and using
