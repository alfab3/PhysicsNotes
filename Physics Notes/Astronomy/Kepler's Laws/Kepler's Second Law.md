A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.

The orbital radius and [[Angular Velocity]] of the planet in the elliptical orbit will vary. The planet travels faster when closer to the Sun, then slower when farther from the sun.

In a small time $dt$ the planet sweeps out a small triangle having base line $r$ and height $rd\theta$ and [[Area]] $dA = \frac{1}{2} r r d\theta$. so the constant [[Areal Velocity]] is:

$$\begin{align} \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{r^2}{2}\frac{d\theta}{dt}\end{align}$$
