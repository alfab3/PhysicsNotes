The [[Fundamental theorem of Calculus]] says that the integral of the derivative of a function is the function. 

We are going to consider some useful generalizations of this theorem to two and three dimensions. The [[Divergence Theorem]] and [[Stokes' Theorem]] are very important in electrodynamics and other applications. We will look at two-dimensional forms of these theorems. First we develop an underlying useful theorem relating an area integral to the line integral around its boundary. 

$$\begin{align}\int\int_A \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \right)dx\ dy = \int_{\partial A} (Pdx+Qdy) \end{align}$$

The line integral is counterclockwise around the boundary of area $A$.
