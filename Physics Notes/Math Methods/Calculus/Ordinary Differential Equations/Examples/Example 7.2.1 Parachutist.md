We want to find the velocity of a falling parachutist as a function of time and are particularly interested in the constant limiting velocity, $v_0$, that comes about by air drag, taken to be quadratic, $-bv^2$, and opposing the force of the gravitational attraction $mg$, of the Earth on the parachutist. we chose a coordinate system in which the positive direction is downward so that the gravitational force is positive. For simplicity we assume that the parachute opens immediately, that is, at time $t=0$, where $v(t)=0$, our initial condition. 
Newton's law applied to the falling parachutist gives 
$$
m\dot{v}=mg-bv^2
$$
where $m$ includes the mass of the parachute.

The terminal velocity, $v_0$ can be found from the equation of motion as $t\rightarrow\infty$; when there is no acceleration, $\dot{v}=0$ and 
$$
bv_0^2 = mg, \; or \;v_0=\sqrt{\frac{mg}{b}}
$$

Rewriting our equation from newton's law: 
$$
\frac{m}{b}\dot{v}=v_0^2-v^2
$$
