Bessel's equation is 
$$
x^2 y'' + xy' + (x^2 - n^2)y = 0
$$

Which gives us 
$$
P(x) = \frac{1}{x}, \; \; Q(x) = 1 - \frac{n^2}{x^2}
$$
which shows that the point $x=0$ is a regular singularity. By inspection we see that there are no other singularities in the infinite range. As $x\rightarrow \infty$ $(z\rightarrow 0)$ we have the coefficients 
$$
\frac{2z-z}{z^2} \; and \; \frac{1-n^2z^2}{z^4}
$$
Since the latter expression diverges as $1/z^4$, the point $x = \infty$ is an irregular, or essential singularity.
