Consider the [[Ordinary Differential Equation]] 
$$
(2x+y)dx+xdy=0
$$
which is homogeneous in $x$ and $y$. Making the substitution $y=xv$, with $dy = xdv + vdx$ the ODE becomes 

$$
(2v+2)dx+xdv = 0
$$
which is separable, with solution $\ln x+\frac{1}{2}\ln(v+1)=C$, which is equivalent to $x^2(v+1)=C$ Forming $y=xv$ the solution can be rearranged into
$$
y = \frac{C}{x}-x
$$
