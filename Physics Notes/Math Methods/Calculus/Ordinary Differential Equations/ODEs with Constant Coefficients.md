Linear and homogeneous terms have constant coefficients. The generic equation of this type is 
$$
\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}+a_{n-1}\frac{d^{n-1}y}{dx^{n-1}}+\dots +a_1\frac{dy}{dx}+a_0y = F(x)
$$
The homogeneous equation corresponding to the above equation has solutions of the form $y=e^{mx}$ where $m$ is a solution of the algebraic equation
$$
m^a+a_{n-1}m^{n-1}+\dots+a_1m+a_0=0
$$
as may be verified by substituion of the assumed form of the solution.

In the case that the $m$ equation has a multiple root, the above prescription will not yield the full set of $n$ linearly independent solutions for the original $n$th order [[Ordinary Differential Equation]]. If one then considers the liniting process in which two roots approach each other, it is possible to conclude that if $e^{mx}$ is a solution, then so is $de^{mx}/dm=xe^{mx}$
