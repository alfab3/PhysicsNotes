We consider ODEs of the general form 
$$
y''+P(x)y'+Q(x)y = F(x)
$$ 
and proceed under the assumption that the corresponding homogeneous equation, with $F(x)=0$, has been solved, thereby obtaining two independent solutions designated $y_1(x)$ and $y_2(x)$. 

Variation of Parameters

The method of variation of parameters starts by writing a particular solution of the inhomogeneous ODE in the form 
$$
y(x)=u_1(x)y_1(x)+u_2(x)y_2(x)
$$

We have specifically written $u_1(x)$ and $u_2(x)$ to emphasize that these are functions of the independent variable, and not constant coefficients. This of course means that this equation does not constitute a restriction to the functional form of $y(x)$. For clarity and compactness, we will usually write these functions just as $u_1$ and $u_2$
