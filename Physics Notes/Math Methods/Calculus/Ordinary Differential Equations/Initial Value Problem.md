The initial value problem is an [[Ordinary Differential Equation]] where y $y_1(t_0), y_2(t_0),...,y_n(t_0)$ are fixed. 

Example:
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x - 3$$

We are given that $y(0) = 4$ when $x = 0, y = 4$. 

$$dx\frac{dy}{dx}=(6x-3)dx$$
$$dy = (6x-3)dx$$
$$\int dy = \int [6x - 3]dx$$
$$y = 3x^2 - 3x + C$$
Which is the general solution we then plug in our given solution.
$$4 = 3(0)^2 - 3(0) + C$$
$$4 = C$$
$$y = 3x^2 - 3x + 4$$
