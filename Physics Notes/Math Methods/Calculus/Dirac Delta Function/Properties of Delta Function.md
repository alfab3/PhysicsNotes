Properties of $\delta(x)$
1) [[Dirac Delta Function]] must be an [[Even Functions]] in $x$, $\delta(-x) = \delta(x)$
2) If $a>0$ $$\begin{align}\delta(ax) = \frac{1}{a}\delta(x), \; \; a > 0 \end{align}$$ which can be proved by making the substitution $x = y/a$ $$\begin{align} \int^\infty_{-\infty} f(x)\delta(ax)dx = \frac{1}{a} \int^\infty_{-\infty} f(y/a) \delta(y)dy = \frac{1}{a}f(0) \end{align}$$ If $a < 0$ the main equation becomes $\delta(ax) = \delta (x)/|a|$
3) Shift of origin $$\begin{align} \int^\infty_{-\infty} \delta(x-x_0)f(x)dx = f(x_0) \end{align}$$ which can be proved by making the substitution $y = x - x_0$ and noting that when $y = 0$, $x = x_0$.
4) If the argument of $\delta(x)$ is a function $g(x)$ with simple zeros at points $a_i$ on the real axis $$\begin{align} \delta \bigg((g(x))\bigg) = \sum_i\frac{\delta(x-a_i)}{|g'(a_i)|} \end{align}$$ To prove this equation we write $$\begin{align} \int^\infty_{-\infty} f(x) \delta(x) dx = \sum_i \int^{a_i + \epsilon}_{a_i-\epsilon} f(x) \delta ((x-a_i)g'(a_i))dx \end{align}$$ where we have decomposed the original integral into a sum of [[Integral]]s over small intervals containing the zeros of $g(x)$ by the leading term in its [[Taylor Series]].
5) [[Derivative]] of delta function: $$\begin{align} \int^\infty_{-\infty} f(x) \delta'(x-x_0)dx = -\int^\infty_{-\infty} f'(x)\delta(x-x_0)dx = -f'(x_0)\end{align}$$ Defining the derivative $\delta'(x)$; it is evaluated by performing integration by parts on any of the sequences defining the delta function.
6) In three dimensions the delta function $\delta(\vec{r})$ is interpreted as $\delta(x)\delta(y)\delta(z)$, so it describes a function localized at the origin and with unit integrated weight, irrespective of the coordinate system in use. Thus, in [[Polar Coordinates]]: $$\begin{align} \int \int \int f(\vec{r_2}) \delta(\vec{r_2}-\vec{r_1})r^2_2dr_2\sin \theta_2d\theta_2d\phi_2 = f(\vec{r_1}) \end{align}$$
7) $$\begin{align} \delta(t-x) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int^\infty_{-\infty} exp(i\omega(t-x))d\omega \end{align}$$ with the understanding that this has meaning only when under an integral sign in that context it is extremely useful for the simplification of fourier integrals
