Having a set of [[Contravariant]] vectors we have, 

$$\begin{gather}x^2 = xx = \sum_{\mu\nu}g_{\mu\nu} x^\mu x^\nu \equiv g_{\mu\nu} x^\mu x^\nu = x^\mu x_\mu\end{gather}$$

In accordance with [[Einstein Summation Convention]] the summation is implied, repeated indices are summed over. 

More explicitly:
$$\begin{gather} \sum^3_{\mu,\nu=}g_{\mu\nu}x^\mu x^\nu = \sum^3_{\mu=0}x^\mu x_\mu \end{gather}$$
