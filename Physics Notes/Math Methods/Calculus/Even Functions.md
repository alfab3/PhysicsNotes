Let $f$ be a real-valued function of a real variable. Then $f$ is even if the following equation holds for all $x$ such that $x$ and $-x$ in the domain of $f$:

$$\begin{align}f(x)=f(-x)\end{align}$$
or equivalently:
$$\begin{align} f(x) - f(-x) =0\end{align}$$

Geometrically, the graph of an even function is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, meaning that its graph remains unchanged after reflection about the y-axis.

Examples of even functions are: 

1) Absolute value - $|x|$
2) $x^2$
3) $x^4$
4) cosine
5) cosh
