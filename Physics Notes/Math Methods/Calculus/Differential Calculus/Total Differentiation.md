If we are given a line $y = f(x)$ in the $x,y$ plane, the slope of a tangential line from any point on said curve is given by the derivative of the line at that point: $$\begin{align} y' = \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx} f(x)\end{align}$$ where $dx$ is the change on the tangent line in the $x$ direction and $dy$ is the change in the tangent line in the $y$ direction

For a function of two variables, say $z = f(x,y)$ we have: $$\begin{align} dz = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}dy \end{align}$$ Where $dx$ is defined as the change in $x$ and $dy$ is defined as the change in $y$.

You can go further to say that a function of any number of variables, let's say $u = f(x,y,z,...)$ then by definition $$\begin{align}du = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}dz + \ldots \end{align}$$
