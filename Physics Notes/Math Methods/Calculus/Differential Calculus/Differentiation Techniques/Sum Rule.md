The derivative of the sum of a function $f$ and a function $g$ is the same as the sum of the derivative of $f$ and the derivative of $g$.
	$$\begin{align} \frac{d}{dx}(f(x)+g(x)) = \frac{d}{dx}(f(x)) + \frac{d}{dx}(g(x)) \end{align}$$
	that is $$\begin{align} j(x) = f(x) + g(x) \rightarrow j'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)\end{align}$$
