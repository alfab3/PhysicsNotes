Show that when $n$ is very large $$\begin{align} \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{(n+1)^2} \cong \frac{2}{n^3}\end{align}$$

If $f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2}$ the desired difference is $\Delta f = f(n) - f(n+1)$. But $\Delta f$ is approsimately $df = d(1/x^2)$ with $x = n$ and $dx = -1$ 

$$\begin{align}d \left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right) = -\frac{2}{x^3}dx = -\frac{2}{n^3}(-1) = \frac{2}{n^3}\end{align}$$
