Let $f$ be a real valued function of a real variable. Then $f$ is odd if the following equation holds for all $x$ such that $x$ and $-x$ are in the domain of $f$

$$\begin{align} -f(x) = f(-x) \end{align}$$

Geometrically, the graph of an odd function has rotaional symmetry with respect to the origin, meaning that its graph remains unchanged after rotation of 180 degrees about the origin.

Examples of odd functions are:

 1) Identity function $x$
 2) $x^3$
 3) sine
 4) sinh
 5) The [[Error Function]] $\text{erf}$
