An integral is used to interpret data which is placed in a graph of any dimension of 2 degrees or higher. The Integral operation (referred to as integration) returns the area under a curve of a given graph. For example, consider a graph of $f(x) = x$ which would just be a diagnonal line stretching from 0 to infinity (let us only consider the positive portion of this curve), now if we wanted to solve for the area under the curve we would say something like this: $$\begin{align} \int_0^a xdx \end{align}$$ Where $a$ is some finite number. It is clear to see that performing this operation will result in some number that defines the area.
$$\begin{align} \int_0^a xdx \\ \frac{x^2}{2}\bigg|^a_0 \\ \frac{a^2}{2} -  \frac{0^2}{2} = \frac{a^2}{2} \end{align}$$ Which you can clearly see is the area of a right triangle where the height and base are the same(which is our case here)
