In the plane, the polar coordinates $r,\theta$ are related to the rectangular coordinates $x,y$ by the equations $$\begin{align} x=rcos\theta \\ y=rsin\theta \end{align}$$

Recall that we found the area element $dydx$ by drawing a grid of lines $x =$ const., $y =$ const., which cut the plane into little rectangles $dx$ by $dy$; the area of one rectanle was then $dydx$. We can make a similar construction for [[Polar Coordinates]] by drawing lines $\theta =$ const. and circles $r =$ const.; we then obtain the grid. $$\begin{align} dA = dr\cdot rd\theta = rdr\theta\end{align}$$

The arc length element $ds$ is given by $$\begin{align} ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2d\theta^2\\ ds=\sqrt{\left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)+r^2}d\theta = \sqrt{1+r^2\left(\frac{d\theta}{dr}\right)^2}dr \end{align}$$
