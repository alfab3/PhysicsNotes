To find the area under a curve in 3D a similar method of using an [[Integral]] is utilized. In 3D it can be interpreted that integration forms 3D rectangular prisms with the ends have area $\Delta A = \Delta x \Delta y$. These extend to the top surface. The sum of these volumes give us an estimate of the total volume. As the number of boxes increases and $\Delta x \rightarrow 0$  and $\Delta y \rightarrow 0$ the estimate gets better. We define the double integral of $f(x,y)$ over the area $A$ in the $(x,y)$ plane as the limit of this sum and we write it as $\int \int_A f(x,y)dxdy$.
