A scalar field or scalar valued function associates a scalar value to every point in a space. The scalar may either be a dimensionless mathematical number of a physical quantity. In a physical context scalar fields are required to be independent of the choice of [[Relativity/Reference Frame]], meaning that any two observers using the same units will agree on the value of the scalar field at the same absolute point in space regardless of their respective points of origin. Examples used in physics include the [[Temperature]] distribution throughout space.
