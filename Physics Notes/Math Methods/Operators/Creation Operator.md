Creation and Annihilation operators are mathematical operators that have widespread applications in [[Quantum Mechanics]], notably in the study of [[Quantum Harmonic Oscillators]] and many particle systems. An annihilation operators (usually denoted by $\hat a$) lowers the number of particles in a given state by one. A creation operator (usually denoted $\hat a^\dagger)$ increases the number of particles in a given state by one, and it is the [[Adjoint]] of the annihilation operator.
