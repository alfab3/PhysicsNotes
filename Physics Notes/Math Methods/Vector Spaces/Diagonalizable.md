A linear operator $L$ is diagonalizable if $V$ has a basis of [[Eigenvectors]] of L.
A theorem: 
$$P_n(L) = 0$$ 
the characteristic polynomial with argument $L$, is the 0 operator. 

$L_1$ and $L_2$ are said to be simultaneously diagonzalizable if there is a basis whose elements are simultaneously [[Eigenvectors]] of $L_1$ and $L_2$
