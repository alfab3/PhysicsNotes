$\norm{\psi} = \bra{\psi}\ket{\psi}^{1/2}$, $\norm{\psi + \phi} < \norm{\psi} + \norm{\phi}$ (triangle inequality). If you take ordinary vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ say, $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = ab\cos{\theta}$. Where theta is the angle between them, and the magnitude of $\cos{\theta}$ is between -1 and 1. It follows that $|\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}| \leq |\vec{a}||\vec{b}|$ Generalized $|\bra{\phi}\ket{\psi}|^2 \leq \bra{\phi}\ket{\phi}\bra{\psi}\ket{\psi}$ Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. When is this an equality or nonparallel. The equality iff $\ket{\phi} = a\ket{\psi}$. If $\phi$ is linearly dependent ([[Linear Independence]])on $\psi$ then the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality becomes an equality.
