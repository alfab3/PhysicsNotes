If term by term a series of terms $u_n$ satisfies $0 \leq u_n \leq a_n$, where the $a_n$ form a covergent series, then the series $\sum_n u_n$ is also convergent. Letting $s_i$ and $s_j$ be partial sums of the $u$ series, with $j > i$, the difference $s_j - s_i$ is $\sum^j_{n = i + 1} u_n$, and this is smaller than the corresponding quantity for the a series, thereby proving convergence. A similar argument shows that if term by term a series of terms $v_n$ satisfies $0 \leq b_n \leq v_n$ where the $b_n$ form a divergent series, then $\sum_n v_n$ is also divergent. 
For the convergent series $a_n$ we already have the geometric series, whereas the harmonic series will serve as the divergent comparison series $b_n$. As other series are identified as either covergent or divergent, they may also be used as the known series for comparison.
