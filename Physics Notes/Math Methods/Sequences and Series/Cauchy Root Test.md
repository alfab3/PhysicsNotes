If $(a_n)^{1/n} \leq r < 1$ for all sufficiently large $n$, with $r$ independent of $n$, then $\sum_n a_n$ is convergent. If $(a_n)^{1/n} \geq 1$ for all sufficiently large $n$, then $\sum_n a_n$ is divergent. 

The first part of this test is verified easily by raising $(a_n)^{1/n}$ to the $n$th power. We get 
$$
a_n \leq r^n < 1
$$

Since $r^n$ is just the $n$th term in a convergent geometric series, $\sum_n a_n$ is convergent by the comparison test. Conversely, if $(a_n)^{1/n} \geq 1$ then $a_n \geq 1$ and the series must diverge.
