The geometric series, starting with $u_0 = 1$ and with a ration of successive terms $r = u_{n+1}/u_n$ has the form 
$$
1 + r + r^2 + r^3+ ... + r^{n-1} + ...
$$
Is $n$th partial sum $s_n$ (that of the first n terms) is
$$
s_n = \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}
$$
Restricting attention to $|r|<1$ so that for large $n$, $r^n$ approaches zero, and $s_n$ posses the limit 
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} s_n \frac{1}{1-r}
$$
Showing that for $|r|< 1$, the geometric series converges. It clearly diverges for $|r| \geq 1$.
