The dot product takes two [[Vectors]] and multiplies each element by the corresponding element in another vector then sums them up. Imagine you had two vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ the dot product of these two vectors geometrically, you would project $\vec{w}$ onto the line that passes through the origin and the tip of $\vec{v}$, then you would multiply the length of the projection by the length the length of $\vec{v}$ is the dot product. So if the the vectors are pointing in the opposite direction the dot product would actually be negative. If they are perpendicular it is zero.
