A projection on a [[Vector Space]] $V$ is a linear operator $P: V\to V$ such that $P^2 = P$. When $V$ has an [[Inner Product]] and is complete (i.e. when $V$ is a Hilbert Space) the concept of orthogonality ([[Orthogonal]]) can be used. A projection $P$ on a Hilbert space $V$ is called an orthogonal projection if it satisfies $\braket{Px,y} = \braket{x,Py}$ for $x,y \in V$. A projection on a Hilbert space that is not orthogonal is called an oblique projection. 

## Projection Matrix
See: [[Projection Operator]] 

In the finite dimensional case a square matrix $P$ is called a projection matrix if it is equal to its square, i.e. if $P^2 = P$. A Square matrix $P$ is called an orthogonal projection matrix if $P^2 = P = P^T$ for a real matrix and respectively $P^2 = P = P^\dagger$  for a complex matrix. A projection matrix that is not an orthogonal projection matrix is called an oblique projection matrix. 

The [[Eigenvalues]] of a projection matrix must be 0 or 1.
