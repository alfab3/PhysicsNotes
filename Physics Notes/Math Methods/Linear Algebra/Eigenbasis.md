Let's think about if the basis vectors just so happened to be [[Eigenvectors]]. Say $\hat{i}$ is scaled by -1 and $\hat{j}$ is scaled by 2. Then the columns of the matrix would look like:
$$\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        -1 \; \; 0 \\
        0 \; \; 2 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}$$
The [[Eigenvalues]] of these [[Eigenvectors]] sit on the diagonal of our matrix, and every other entry is a 0. In this case(when the only non-zero values are along the diagonal) the matrix is called a diagonal matrix. The way to interpret this is all [[Basis Vectors]] are [[Eigenvectors]], with the values along the diagonal being their respective [[Eigenvalues]].
