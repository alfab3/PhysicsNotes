In linear algebra, the trace of a square matrix $\mathbf A$, denoted $\text{tr}(\mathbf A)$, is defined to be the sum of elements on the main diagonal (from the upper left to the lower right) of $\mathbf A$. 

The trace of a matrix is the sum of its (complex) [[Eigenvalues]], (counted with multiplicities), and it is invariant with respect to a [[Change of Basis]]. The characterization can be used to define the trace of a linear operator in general. The trace is only defined for a square matrix ($n\times n)$ 

The trace is related to the [[Derivative]] of the [[Determinant]]
