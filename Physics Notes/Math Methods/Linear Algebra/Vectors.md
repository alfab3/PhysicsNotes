The fundamental piece of linear algebra is known as the vector. The coordinates of a vector is a pair of numbers that gives instructions of how to get from the tail of the vector (in our case the origin) to its tip. In a two dimensional vector say: 
$$\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    -2\\
    3
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}$$ 
The first number corresponds with the $x$ distance and the second number corresponds to the $y$ distance. A three dimensional vector consists of 3 values, similar to the two dimensional vector with the first and second value corresponding to the $x$ and $y$ distances, the third value represents a new $z$ direction.

A popular way of representing elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is to write them: $(x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n)$ or as a column vector:
$$\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x_1\\
    x_2\\
    \vdots \\
    x_n
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}$$

In Dirac Notation: $$\ket{\psi} \in V$$ $$\bra{\phi} \in \tilde{V}$$
