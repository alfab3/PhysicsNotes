If we look at one particular vector when then transformation occurs the vector gets knocked off the span. Some special [[Vectors]] remain on their span, they just get stretched or squished. In this special case the $x$ component of the vector spans the x-axis. So the two vectors that exhibit this property are vectors along the $x,y = -1$ diagonal and the line x = 0. These special [[Vectors]] are called the [[Eigenvectors]] of the transformation([[Linear Transformations and Matrices]]), and each have associated with it whats called an ([[Eigenvalues]])eigenvalue. Which is just the factor by which it is stretched or squished to remain on the span. [[Eigenvalues]] can be positive or negative. 

$$\begin{align}
    A \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}
\end{align}$$
Where $A$ is the transformation matrix, and $\vec{v}$ is the eigenvector(([[Eigenvectors]]), and $\lambda$ is the corresponding eigenvalue.
