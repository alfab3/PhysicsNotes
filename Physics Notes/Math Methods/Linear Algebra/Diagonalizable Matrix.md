A square matrix $A$ is called diagonalizable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix, if there exists an invertible matrix $P$ and a diagonal matrix $D$ such that $$\begin{gather} P^{-1}AP = D \end{gather}$$

A matrix that can be brought to diagonal form by a [[Change of Basis]]  is said to be diagonalizable (evidently a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its [[Eigenvectors]] [[Span]] the space). The similarity matrix that effects the diagonalization can be constructed by using the eigenvectors (in the old basis) as the columns of $S^{-1}$:

$$\begin{gather} (S^{-1})_{ij}-(a^{(j)})\end{gather}$$
