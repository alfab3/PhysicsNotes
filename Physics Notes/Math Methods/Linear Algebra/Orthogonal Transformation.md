A [[Linear Transformation]] $T:V\to V$ on a real [[Inner Product Spaces]] $V$, that preserves the [[Inner Product]]. That is, for each pair $u,v$ of elements $V$ we have $$\begin{gather} \braket{u,v} \end{gather} = \braket{Tu,Tv}$$ 

Since the lengths of vectors and angles between them are defined through the inner product, orthogonal transformations preserve lengths of vectors and angles between them. In particular, orthogonal transformations map [[Orthonormal Basis]] to [[Orthonormal Basis]]

Orthogonal transformations in two or three dimensional [[Euclidean Space]] are stiff rotations, reflects, or combinations of a rotation and reflection
