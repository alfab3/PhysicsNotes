We say a vector is linearly independent of another set of vectors if the former can not be written as a linear combination of the latter. Say we have $\ket{\phi_1}, ... \ket{\phi_r}$ are linearly independent if the equation $a\ket{\phi_1} + ... + a_r \ket{\phi_r} = 0$ implies that $a_1 = 0 = a_2 = ... = a_r$ then this set of vectors is linearly independent.

The vectors $\ket{v_1}, ... \ket{v_n}$ are said to be linearly independent if the only set of elements $$\{\lambda^1, \lambda^2, ..., \lambda^n\}\in F^n$$ for which $$\lambda^1 \ket{v_1} + \lambda^2 \ket{v_2} + ... + \lambda^n \ket{v_n} = \ket{0} $$ is the set set $$\lambda^1 = \lambda^2 = \lambda^n = 0$$

Conversely $\ket{v_1}, \ket{v_2}, ..., \ket{v_n}$ are linearly dependent if there is a set of numbers $\lambda^1, \lambda^2,...,\lambda^n$ not all vanishing such that: $$\lambda^1 \ket{v_1} + \lambda^2 \ket{v_2} + ... + \lambda^n \ket{v_n} = \ket{0}$$
