Also known as the adjoint matrix or Hermitian transpose of an m by n matrix $A$ with complex entries is the n by m matrix obtained from $A$ by taking the [[Transpose]] and then taking the [[Complex Conjugate]] of each entry.

The Conjugate transpose of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ is formally defined by:
$$\begin{align} (A^H)_{ij}=\overline{A}_{ji}\end{align}$$
