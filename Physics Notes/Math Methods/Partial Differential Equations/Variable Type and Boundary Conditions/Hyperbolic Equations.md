Characterize a family of wave-like phenomena. Namely one of the variables is "time-like" whereas the other(s) are space-like. 

That is: $y \to t$:

$$\begin{gather} \frac{\partial ^2\phi}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial t^2} \\ \nabla^2\phi = \frac{1}{c}
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2}\end{gather}$$

Where $c$ is the speed of light/sound/etc amd $\nabla$ is the [[Laplacian]].

To understand how this wave-like nature implies the type of BC's admissible by hyperbolic equations let us think of the analogue of wave equation in 0 spatial dimensions. Here the wave equation becomes $$\begin{gather} \frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial t^2} = 0 \end{gather}$$

Which should be reorganized as the homogeneous version of [[Newton's Second Law]]. Namely $$\begin{gather}\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=F(t)\end{gather}$$

This analogy implies that the type of BC for wave equation (and more generally hyperbolic equations) is always 2 initial equations on an open curve in the $x-y$ space
