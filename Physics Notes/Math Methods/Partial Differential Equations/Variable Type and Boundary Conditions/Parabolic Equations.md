Parabolic Equations are characterized by one variable such that the highest order derivative of $\phi$ with respect to it is only first order. This defines a family of diffusion-like phenomena,  that is $y\to t$("time-like" variable) Whereas the other variable(s) are space-like

That is:
$$\begin{gather} \frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial x^2} = D \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}\end{gather}$$ or in higher dimensions:

$$\begin{gather} \nabla^2\phi=D\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \end{gather}$$

Where $\nabla^2$ is the [[Laplacian]]
