Elliptic Equations are of the form of [[Laplace's Equations]] (e.g. potential in electrostatics) where all variables are space-like
$$\begin{gather} \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial y^2} = 0\end{gather}$$

or in higher dimensions: 

$$\begin{gather}\nabla^2 \phi = 0\end{gather}$$

Where $\nabla^2$ is the [[Laplacian]]
