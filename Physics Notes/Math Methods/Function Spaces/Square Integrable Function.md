Also called a quadratically integrable function or $L^2$ function is a real or complex valued measurable function for which the [[Integral]] of the square of the absolute value is finite. $$\begin{align} \int^\infty_{-\infty}|f(x)|^2dx < \infty \end{align}$$

Properties
The square integrable functions form an [[Inner Product Spaces]] with [[Inner Product]] given by $$\begin{align} \braket{f,g} = \int_A \overline{f(x)}g(x)dx \end{align}$$

Where $f \; \text{and} \; g$ are square integrable functions
$f(x)$ is the [[Complex Conjugate]] of $f(x)$ 
$A$ is the set over which one integratesass
