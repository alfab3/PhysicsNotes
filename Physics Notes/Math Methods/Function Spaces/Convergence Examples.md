Example 1:
Consider the sequence $f_n = x^n$ $(n=1,2,...)$ and $\mathcal{D} = [0,1)$. Here, the round and square bracket notation means that the point $x = 0$ is included in the interval, but the point 1 is excluded. 

A $n$ becomes large we have $x^n \rightarrow 0$ pointwise in $\mathcal{D}$, but the [[Convergence]] is not uniform because 
$$
\sup_{x\in\mathcal{D}}|x^n-0|=1
$$
for all $n$.

Example 2:
Let $f_n = x^n$ with $\mathcal{D}=[0,1]$. In this case we have neither uniform nor pointwise convergence of the $x^n$ to zero, but $x^n \rightarrow 0$ in the mean.
