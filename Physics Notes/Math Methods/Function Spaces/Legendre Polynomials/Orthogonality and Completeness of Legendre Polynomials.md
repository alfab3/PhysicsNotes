The standardization $P_n(1)=1$ fixes the normalization of the [[Legendre Polynomials]]. Since they are also orthogonal with respect to the same [[Norm]], the two statements can be combined into the single equation:

$$\begin{gather}\int^{1}_{-1}P_m(x)P_n(x)dx=\frac{2}{2n+1}\delta_{nm} \end{gather}$$

where $\delta_{nm}$ is the [[Kronecker Delta]].
