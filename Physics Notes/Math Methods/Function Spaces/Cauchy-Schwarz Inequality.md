The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for all vectors $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ of an [[Inner Product Spaces]] it is true that 
$$\begin{gather} |\braket{u,v}|^2 \leq \braket{u,u} \cdot \braket{v,v} \end{gather}$$

Where $\braket{\cdot,\cdot}$ represents the inner product operation. 

It can also be written as: 

$$\begin{gather} |\braket{u,v}|\leq ||u||\ ||v|| \end{gather}$$
Where $||u||^2$ is the [[Norm]]
