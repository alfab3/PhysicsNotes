A tool used to evaluate [[Line Integrals]] of [[Analytic Function]]s over closed curved, it can often be used to compute real integrals and [[Infinite Series]] as well. 

It is a special case of the generalized [[Stokes' Theorem]].

On a domain $U$ is there is a closed curved $y$ such that:

$$\begin{align}\oint_\gamma f(z)dz =2\pi i \sum Res(f, a_k) \end{align}$$

Where Res defines the Residue function which is the $a_{-1}$ of the [[Laurent Series]].
