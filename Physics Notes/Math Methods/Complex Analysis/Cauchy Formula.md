Consider an [[Analytic Function]] $f(z)$ in $\Omega$. 
Then $$\begin{align} f(z_0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\Gamma} \frac{f(z)}{z-z_0} dz\end{align}$$

Where $\Gamma$ is any closed contour in $\Omega$ that encloses $z_0$. 

This tells us that once an analytic function is specified on any closed curve it completely determines the values of the function at any point inside $\Gamma$
