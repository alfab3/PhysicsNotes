A [[Coordinate Systems]] in a plane that specifies each point uniquely by a pair of numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines, measured in the same unit of length. Each reference line is called a coordinate axis of the system and where they meet is the origin at ordered pair $(0,0)$. The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the perpendicular projections of the point on the two axes. This can also be applied to a a system of [[Dimension]] order 3.

Conventionally labeled as: 

$$\begin{gather} (x,y,z) \\(x_1,x_2,x_3) \end{gather}$$

In [[Cartesian Coordinates]] we describe each point $\vec x$ in $3D$ space by a triad $(x,y,z)$ the corresponding unit vectors are defined through the variation of $\vec x (\vec x \rightarrow \vec x + d\vec x)$ upon changing each of the coordinates:

$$\begin{gather} \hat x = \frac{\partial \vec x}{\partial x}; & \hat y = \frac{\partial \vec x}{\partial y}; & \hat z = \frac{\partial \vec x}{\partial z} \end{gather}$$

The triad $(\hat x,\hat y, \hat z) = (\hat i, \hat j, \hat k)$ is everywhere:

Orthogonal:
$$\begin{gather}\hat x \cdot \hat y = \hat z \cdot \hat x = \hat y \cdot \hat z = 0 \end{gather}$$

Fixed in space:
$$\begin{gather} \frac{\partial \hat x}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial \hat x}{\partial y} =\frac{\partial \hat x}{\partial z} = 0 \end{gather}$$
