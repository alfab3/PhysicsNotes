### General Form
The wave equation is a [[2nd Order Linear PDEs]] (hyperbolic)

$$\begin{gather} \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial t^2} -c^2\nabla^2U = 0 \end{gather}$$

Let's look at the 2D case (1 spatial [[Dimension]] and 1 temporal) for $u(x,t)$

$$\begin{gather} \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial t^2} -c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = 0 \end{gather}$$


### Boundary Conditions
This comes from [[Newton's Second Law]]. This implies the type of [[Cauchy Boundary Conditions]] that needed to be supplied for its solution. That is the initial value of $u$ (akin to displacement) and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}$ (akin to [[Velocity]]) must be provided at each value of $x$ at $t=0$. That is: $u(x,t=0) = f(x), \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x, t = 0) = g(x)$. Where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are given.
