### Derivation of Wave Equation from Lagrangian
To solve for the wave equation, we use the [[Lagrangian]] with kinetic energy defined as $$\begin{gather}\frac{1}{2}(p\cdot dx)\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\right)^2\end{gather}$$

and potential energy defined as 
$$\begin{gather} \frac{1}{2}T\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)^2\end{gather}$$
Length - $L$
Mass density (per unit length) - $\rho$
tension - $T$

The Lagrangian is then:

$$\begin{gather} \mathcal L = \int dt \int^L_{x=0}\left[\frac{1}{2}(p)\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\right)^2 -\frac{1}{2}T\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)^2\right]dx\end{gather}$$

and the wave equation is obtained as [[Euler-Lagrange Equation]]s from this Lagrangian
