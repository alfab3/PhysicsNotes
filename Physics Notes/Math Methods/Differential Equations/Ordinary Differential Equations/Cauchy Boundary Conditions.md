Simple and common in [[Second Order Linear ODEs]] 

$$\begin{gather} y'' = f(y(s),y'(s),s) \end{gather}$$

where in order to ensure that a unique solution $y(s)$ exists, one must specify the value of the function $y$ and the value of the derivative $y'$ at a given point $s=a$:

$$\begin{gather} y(a) = \alpha\\ y'(a) = \beta \end{gather}$$

Where $a$ is a boundary or initial point.
