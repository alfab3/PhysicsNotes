Is the theory of real second order linear [[Ordinary Differential Equation]]s of the form $$\begin{align} \frac{d}{dx}\left[p(x) \frac{dy}{dx} \right] + q(x)y = -\lambda \omega(x) y\end{align}$$

for given coefficient functions $p(x)$, $q(x)$, and $\omega(x)$ and an unknown function $y$ of the free variable $x$ where $\omega(x)$ is the weight function. 

All [[Second Order Linear ODEs]] can be reduced to this form.
