A differential equation can be homogeneous in either of two respects. 
A [[First Order Differential Equations]] are said to be homogeneous if it may be written $$\begin{align} f(x,y)dy = g(x,y)dx \end{align}$$
where $f$ and $g$ are homogeneous functions of the same degree of $x$ and $y$. In this case, the change of variable $y = ux$ leads to an equation of the form $$\begin{align}\frac{dx}{x} = h(u)du\end{align}$$ which is easy to solve by integration of the two members.
