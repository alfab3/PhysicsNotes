In variational problems we are provided with an expression $J[y]$ that "eats" whole functions $y(x)$ and returns a single number. Such objects are called functionals to distinguish them from ordinary functions. An ordinary function is a map $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. A functional $J$ is a map $J:C^\infty(\mathbb{R}) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ is the space of smooth (having derivatives of all orders) functions. To find the function $y(x)$ that maximizes or minimizes a given functional $J[y]$ we beed to define and evaluate, its [[Functional Derivative]]
