Find the general solutions to the following ODEs. Write the solutions in forms that are entirely real. 
$$
y''' - 2y''-y'+2y=0
$$

Try solution $e^{mx}$. The condition on $m$ is $m^3-2m^2 - m + 2 = 0$ with roots $m=2$, $m=1$, $m=-1$ The general solution to the ODE is therefore $c_1e^{2x}+c_2e^x+c_3e^{-x}$.
