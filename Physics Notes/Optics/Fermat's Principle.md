Also known as the principle of least time. States that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time. In order to be true in all cases, this statement must be weakend by replacing the "least" time with a time that is statrionary with respect to variations of the path - so that a deviation in the path caises, at most, a second-order change in the traversal time.
