Suppose we have a 2-dimensional real vector: $(x,y)$. Some properties of this vector include addition, [[Dot Product]], [[Cross Product]], etc. 

In complex math a product of two 2-dimensional [[Vectors]] is defined as: 
$$\begin{align} (x_1,y_1) \cdot (x_2,y_2) = (x_1,x_2 - y_1y_2,x_1y_2 + x_2y_1) \end{align}$$
This way the product remains a 2D vector

If we take the [[Basis Vectors]] and rewrite our vector as a [[Linear Combination]] of the basis vectors we would have something that looks like this:

$$\begin{align} (x,y) = x(1,0) + y(0,1)\end{align}$$

Where (1,0) and (0,1) are the basis vectors. In this example $x(1,0)$ will represent the real number set and $y(0,1)$ will represent the imaginary number set. So $(1,0)$ is "1" and (0,1) is "$i$". Which converts the above formula to $(x,y) = x + iy$. 

Note that (using the complex product rule): 
$$\begin{align} (1,0)\cdot(1,0) = (1,0) \\ (0,1) \cdot (0,1) = (-1,0)\end{align}$$

One can think of complex algebra $\mathbb{C}$ as 2D vectors denoted as $z = (x,y)$ equipped with addition and the above product rule.
