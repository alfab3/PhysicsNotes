 In [[Particle Physics]] asymptotic freedom is a property that causes interactions between particles to become asymptotically weaker as the energy scale increases and the corresponding length scale decreases. 

Asymptotic freedom is a feature of [[Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)]], the [[Quantum Field Theory]] of the [[Strong Interaction]] between [[Quarks]] and [[Gluons]], the fundamental constituents of nuclear matter. Quarks interact weakly at high energies, allowing perturbative calculations. At low energies, the interaction becomes strong, leading to the confinement of quarks and gluons within composite [[Hadrons]].
