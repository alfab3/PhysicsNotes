In [[Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)]], color confinement, often simply called confinement, is the phenomenon that [[Color-Charged]] cannot be isolated, and therefore cannot be directly observed in normal conditions below the [[Hagedorn Temperature]]. Quarks and gluons must clump together to form [[Hadrons]]. The two main types of hadron are the [[Meson]]s (one [[Quarks]] and one [[Antiquark]]) and the [[Baryons]] (three quarks). In addition, colorless [[Glueball]]s formed only of [[Gluons]] are also consistent with confinement, though difficult to identify experimentally. Quarks and gluons cannot be separated from their parent hadron without producing new hadrons.
