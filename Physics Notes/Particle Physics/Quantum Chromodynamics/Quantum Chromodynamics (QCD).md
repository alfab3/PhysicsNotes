The theory of the [[Strong Interaction]] between [[Quarks]] mediated by [[Gluons]]. QCD is a type of [[Quantum Field Theory]].

The QCD analog of [[Electric Charge]] is a property called [[Color]]. Gluons are the force carriers, just as photons are for the electromagnetic force in quantum electrodynamics.

QCD exhibits three salient properties:

[[Color Confinement]]

[[Asymptotic Freedom]] 

[[Chiral Symmetry Breaking]]
