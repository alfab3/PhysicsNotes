Bremsstrahlung (i.e. braking radiation or deceleration radiation) is electromagnetic radiation produced by deceleration of a [[Charged Particles]] when deflected by another charged particle, typically an [[Electrons]] by an [[Atomic Nucleus]]. The moving particle loses [[Classical Mechanics/Newtonian Dynamics/Kinetic Energy]], which is converted into radiation (i.e. [[Photons]]), thus satisfying the law of [[Conservation of Energy]]. The term is also used to refer to the process of producing the radiation. 

Broadly speaking, bremsstrahlung or braking radiation is any radiation produced to the deceleration of a charged particle, which includes the synchotron radiation (i.e. photon emission by a relativistic particle), cyclotron radiation (i.e. photon emission by a non-relativistic particle), and the emission of [[Electrons]] and [[Positrons]] during [[Beta Decay]]
