## Proportional Chambers
#### Proportional tubes 
A cylindrical tube of radius $r_a$ on negative potential and central wire (radius $r_i$) on positive potential create an electric field of the form 
$$\begin{gather} E(r)=V_0/(r \ln(r_a/r_i)) \end{gather}$$

An electron liberated in an ionization process gains the kinetic $\Delta T$ between two collisions at radial distances $r_1$ and $r_2$ 

$$\begin{gather}\Delta T = e\int^{r_2}_{r_1} E(r)dr \end{gather}$$

and if $\Delta T$ exceeds the ionization energy of the gas atoms, a secondary ionization can take place.
