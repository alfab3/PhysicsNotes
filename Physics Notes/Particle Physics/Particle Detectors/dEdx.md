$dE/dx$ is the rate of energy loss over distance from a charged particle detector in some material. If you measure $dE/dx$ as a function of momentum $(p)$ this can be used as a form of particle identification, because different types of particles follow different curves in this distribution.

Use relativistic rise of $dE/dx$ PID [[Particle ID]]. 

$\mu /\pi$ separation impossible, but $\pi/K/\rho$ generally be achievable
