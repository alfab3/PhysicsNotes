## Physical Processes for detection
The physical processes which enable us to detect particles are different for neutral and charged particles. [[Photons]] can interact by [[Photoelectric Effect]] or [[Compton Effect]] or by [[pair creation]]. The resulting electrons and positrons can be detected by their electromagnetic interaction. Neutrons of very high energy will produce a shower of [[Hadrons]] when colliding with detector material, thus enabling the detection the detection of charged secondaries. [[Neutrinos]] interact by weak interaction conserving [[Lepton Number]], producing hadrons and a charged or neutral lepton.

Charged particles can be detected directly by their electromagnetic interaction with atomic electrons of the detector material. 

Energy loss of a heavy charged particle is given by:
$$\begin{gather} -\frac{dE}{dx} = (4\pi r_e^2m_ec^2N_0Zz^2/A\beta^2)[\ln(2m_ec^2\beta^2/((1-\beta^2)I))-\beta^2] \end{gather}$$

Where: 
$x$ - thickness of material traversed in g cm$^{-2}$
$N_0$ - [[Avogadro's Number]]
$Z$ and $A$ - atomic and mass numbers of the material
$ze$ and $v=\beta c$ - the charge and velocity of moving particle
$m_e$ - electron mass
$r_e$ = 2.8fm classical electron radius
$I$- an effective atomic ionization potential ranging from 13.5eV to 1 keV in lead.
