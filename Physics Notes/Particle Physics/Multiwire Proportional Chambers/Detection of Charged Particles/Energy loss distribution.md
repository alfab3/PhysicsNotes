The fact that in thin materials the total energy loss is given by a small amount of interaction, each one with a very wide range of possible energy transfers, determines a characteristic shape for the energy loss distribution. In a classical formulation due to Landau, the energy-loss distribution in thin media is written as 

$$\begin{gather} f(\lambda) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-1/2(\lambda+e^{-\lambda})} \end{gather}$$

where the reduced energy variable $\lambda$ represents the normalized deviation from the most probable energy loss $(\Delta E)_{mp}$:

$$\begin{gather} \lambda = \frac{\Delta E - (\Delta E)_{mp}}{\xi}  & \xi = K \frac{Z}{A}\frac{\rho}{\beta^2}X\end{gather}$$

$\Delta E$ being the actual loss and $\xi$ the average energy loss given by the first term in the [[Bethe Formula]].
