In ionizing encounters, the ejected electron is liberated with an energy $E$ that can assume any value, up to the maximum allowed $E_M$. An approximate expression for the probability of an electron receiving the energy $E$ is given by: $$\begin{gather} P(E) = K \frac{Z}{A}\frac{\rho}{\beta^2} \frac{X}{E^2} \end{gather}$$

that corresponds essentially to the first term of the [[Bethe Formula]].
If the reduced thickness $X = X\delta$ is introduced and given in g cm$^{-2}$ the expression can conveniently written as: 

$$\begin{gather}P(E)dE = \frac{K}{\beta^2}\frac{Z}{A}\frac{x}{E^2}dE = W\frac{dE}{E^2} \end{gather}$$
Electrons ejected with an energy above a few keV are normally called $\delta$-rays. The number of $\delta$ electrons ejected with energy $E_0$ or greater can be found by the expression: 

$$\begin{gather}N(E \geq E_0) = \int^{E_M}_{E_0} P(E) dE = W\left(\frac{1}{E_0}-\frac{1}{E_M}\right)\approx \frac{W}{E_0}\end{gather}$$
