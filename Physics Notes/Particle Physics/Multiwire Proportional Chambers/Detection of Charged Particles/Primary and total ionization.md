On the passage of the particle, a discrete number of primary ionizing collisions takes place which liberate electron-ion pairs in the medium. The [[Electrons]] ejected can have enough energy (larger than the ionization potential of the medium) to further ionize producing secondary [[Ion]] pairs; the sum of the two contributions is called total ionization. 
The total number of ion pairs can be conveniently expressed by: 

$$\begin{gather} n_T = \frac{\Delta E}{W_i} \end{gather}$$ 

Where $\Delta E$ is the total energy loss in the gas volume considered and $W_i$ is the effective energy to produce one pair.
