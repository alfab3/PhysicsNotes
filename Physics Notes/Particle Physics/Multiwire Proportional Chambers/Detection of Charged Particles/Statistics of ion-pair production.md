The primary ionization encounters, being  a small number of independent events, follow Poisson like statistics; if $n$ is the average number of primary interactions $(n=n_p)$. 

The actual number $k$ in one event will have a probability
$$\begin{gather} p^n_k=\frac{n^k}{k!}e^{-n}\end{gather}$$

The inefficiency of a perfect detector is therefore given by $$\begin{gather} 1-\epsilon=p^n_0 = e^{-n}\end{gather}$$
