An expression for the average differential energy loss due to Coulomb interactions has been obtained by Bethe and Bloch in the framework of relativistic quantum mechanics , and can be written as follows: 

$$\begin{gather} \frac{dE}{dx}=-K\frac{z}{A}\frac{\rho}{\beta^2}\left\{\ln\frac{2mc^2\beta^2E_M}{I^2(1-\beta^2)}-2\beta^2\right\}, & K = \frac{2\pi Nz^2e^4}{mc^2}\end{gather}$$

where $N$ is the [[Avogadro's Number]], $m$ and $e$ are the [[Electron mass]] and [[Electron Charge]], $Z$, $A$, and $\rho$ are the [[Atomic Number]] and mass, and the density of the medium, respectively and $I$ is its effective ionization potential; $z$ is the charge and $\beta$ is the velocity of the projectile. 

The quantity $E_M$ represents the maximum energy transfer allowed in each interaction, and simple two-body relativistic kinematics gives 
$$\begin{gather} E_M = \frac{2mc^2\beta^2}{1-\beta^2} \end{gather}$$

For example, for 1 GeV/c protons $E_M$ = 1.2 MeV. Not always, however, can this kinematical limit be used, particularly in this case of thin detectors where energy can escape in the form of $\delta$-rays.
It is customary to substitute for length $X$ a reduced length $x$ defined as $X_\rho$ and measured in g cm$^{-2}$. In this case the reduced energy loss can be written as 

$$\begin{gather} \frac{dE}{dx} = \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{dE}{dx} \end{gather}$$

The value of the effective ionization potential $I$ is in general the result of a measurement for each material; a rather good approximation is, however $I = I_0Z$ with $I_0 \approx 12 eV$.
