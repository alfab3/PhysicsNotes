At very high momenta, above 10 GeV/c or so , the logarithmic term in the Bethe-Block formula produces an increase of the energy loss; this may constitute a basis for particle identification at very high energies since for a given momentum the average energy loss will be slightly different for different masses. Polarization effects, not taken into account by the formula of $dE/dx$ found here: [[Energy loss due to electromagnetic interactions]], however produce a saturation in the increase, that would otherwise indefinitely continue. In gases, saturation occurs around a few hundred GeV/c at a value which is about 50% minimum ionizing.
