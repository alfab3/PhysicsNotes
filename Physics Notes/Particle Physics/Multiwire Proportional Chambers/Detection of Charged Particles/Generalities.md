Electromagnetic interaction between particles and gas are the basis of detection. We will look at highly probable incoherent Coulomb interactions between the electromagnetic fields of the incoming charged particle and of the medium, resulting in both excitation and ionization of the atoms of the medium itself. The contribution of other electromagnetic processes (at least for particles heavier than electrons), such as  [[Bremsstrahlung]], [[Cerenkov]], and transition radiation to the total energy loss is negligible in gas detectors and will be ignored.
