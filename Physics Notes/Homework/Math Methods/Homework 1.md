Problem 1: Not a vector space?

In each of the following cases, determine whether the set $V$ with the specified operators of addition and scalar multiplication is a vector space over the specified field. If it is a vector space, prove it (verify all the axioms) and determine its dimension. If it is not, determine which axioms are satisifed and which are not satisfied.

a) $F = \mathbb{R}$ Vectors are lists of $n$ positive real numbers, $ket{x_1,...,x_n}$ with $x_i > 0$. Vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined by 

>$$\ket{x_1,...,x_n} + \ket{y_1,...,y_n} := \ket{x_1 y_1,...,x_n y_n}$$


>$$r\ket{x_1,...,x_n} := \ket{x^r_1,...,x^r_n}$$
