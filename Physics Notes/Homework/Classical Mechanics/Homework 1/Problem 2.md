Prove $\ddot{R}=0$. Note that the particular form of the denominator in 
$$
\vec{R} = \frac{\sum^N_{i=1}m_i\vec{r_i}}{\sum^N_{i=1}m_i}
$$
is not relevent to the proof, and comment on why it is important to have this denominator in the definition of the center of mass. 

Hint: See how the vector $\vec{R}$ changes when the positions of all the particles are shifted by one and the same vector $r_0$, paying special attention to the role of the denominator in this transformation. 

Proof: 
The denominator is used to be able to treat the system as a point particle.

The system is isolated therefore there is no external force causing acceleration, the internal force would be the same throughout the system so their would be no acceleration.
