The physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an [[Electromagnetic Field]]. Electric charge can be positive or negative. Like charges repel and unlike charges attract each other. An object with an absence of net charge is referred to as neutral. 

Electric charge is a conserved property; the net charge of an isolated system, the amount of positive charge minus the amount of negative charge, cannot change. Electric charge is carried by subatomic particles.
