An electric field is the physical field that surrounds electrically charged particles and exerts force on all other charged particles in the field, either attracting or repelling them. It also refers to the physical field for a system of charged particles. Electric fields originate from electric charges or from time varying magnetic fields. Electric fields and magnetic fields are both manifestations of the [[Electromagnetic Force]]. 

The electric field is defined mathematically as a [[Vector Field]] that associates to each point in space force per unit of charge exerted on an infinitesimal positive [[Test Charge]] at rest at that point. The units for the electric field are volts per meter or Newtons per Coulomb. 

## Mathematical Formulation

$$\begin{gather} \vec E(\vec x_0) = \frac{\vec F}{q_0} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1}{(\vec x_1 - \vec x_0)}\hat r_{1,0}\end{gather}$$
