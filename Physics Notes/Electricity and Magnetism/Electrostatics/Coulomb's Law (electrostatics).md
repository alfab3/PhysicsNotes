Consider a distribution of charges:

The force of the [[Electric Charge]]s on each other can be found by: 

$$\begin{gather} F = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r_{12}^2}\hat r_{12} \end{gather}$$

Which reads: "force on charge $q_1$ due to the [[Electric Field]] of $q_2$

Where $k$ is defined as: $$\begin{gather} \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} = 9 x 10^9 N\frac{m^2}{c^2}\end{gather}$$ and $\epsilon_0$ is the [[Permitivity of vacuum]].

Coulomb's law can be written down similarly. If $\mathbf F$ is the force on a point charge $q_1$ located at $\mathbf x_1$, due to another point charge $q_2$ located at $\mathbf x_2$ then Coulomb's law is:

$$\begin{gather} \mathbf F = kq_1q_2\frac{\mathbf x - \mathbf x_1}{|\mathbf x - \mathbf x_1|^3} \end{gather}$$ 

Where using the [[Unit Vector Formula]] this can be rewritten as: 

$$\begin{gather} F = k\frac{q_1q_2}{|\mathbf x - \mathbf x_1|^2}\hat x \end{gather}$$
