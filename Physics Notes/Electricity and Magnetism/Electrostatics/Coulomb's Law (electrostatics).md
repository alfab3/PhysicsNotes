Consider a distribution of charges:

The force of the [[Electric Charge]]s on each other can be found by: 

$$\begin{gather} F = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r_{12}^2}\hat r_{12} \end{gather}$$

Which reads: "force on charge $q_1$ due to the [[Electric Field]] of $q_2$

Where $k$ is defined as: $$\begin{gather} \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} = 9 x 10^9 N\frac{m^2}{c^2}\end{gather}$$ and $\epsilon_0$ is the [[Permitivity of vacuum]].
