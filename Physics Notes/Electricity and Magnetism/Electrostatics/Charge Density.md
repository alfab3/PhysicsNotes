Charge density is the amount of [[Electric Charge]] per unit length, surface area, or volume. Measured in [[Coulomb]]s per unit length, area or volume.

A discrete set of point charges can be described with a charge density by means of delta functions. For example: 

$$\begin{gather} \rho(\mathbf x) = \sum^n_{i=1}q_i\delta(\mathbf x - \mathbf x_i) \end{gather}$$

represents a distribution of $n$ point charges $q_i$, located at the points $\mathbf x_i$.
