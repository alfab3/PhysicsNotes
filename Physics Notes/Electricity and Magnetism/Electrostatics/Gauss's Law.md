### Conceptual Definition
In electromagnetism, Gauss's Law, also known as Gauss's [[Flux]] theorem, is a law relating the distribution of [[Electric Charge]]to the resulting [[Electric Field]]. In its integral form it states that the flux of the electric field out of an arbitrary closed surface is proportional to the electric field across a surface enclosing any [[Charge Distribution]], irrespective of how that charge is distributed. Even though the law alone is insufficient to determine the electric field across a surface enclosing any charge distribution, this may be possible in cases where symmetry mandates uniformity of the field. Where no such symmetry exists, Gauss's law can be used in its differential form, which states that the [[Divergence]] of the electric field is proportional to the local density of charge.

### Integral Form
Gauss's Law may be expressed as: 

$$\begin{gather} \Phi_E = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0} \end{gather}$$

where $\Phi_E$ is the [[Electric Flux]] through a closed surface $S$ enclosing any volume $V$, $Q$ is the total charge enclosed within $V$ and $\epsilon_0$  is the permittivity of free space. The flux is defined as a [[Surface Integrals]] of the electric field:

$$\begin{gather}\Phi_E = \iint_S \vec E \cdot dA\end{gather}$$

where $E$ is the [[Electric Field]], $dA$ is a vector representing an infinitesimal element of area of the surface.

### Differential Form
By the [[Divergence Theorem]] Gauss's law can alternatively be written in the differential form:

$$\begin{gather} \nabla \cdot \vec E = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r} \end{gather}$$
