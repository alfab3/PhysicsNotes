The method of images is a very useful approach to find the electrostatic field in various geometries. We will study it through examples:

### Example 1

At $x \geq 0$ we have $\vec E = 0$ (conductor) we need to solve the problem at $x < 0$ (vacuum).

In the absence of the conductor, the [[Electric Potential]] would have been obviously: 

$$\begin{gather} \phi(\vec x) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{\vec x + d \hat i}\end{gather}$$

However this potential is: 

$$\begin{gather} \phi(x = 0, y, z) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{\sqrt{y^2+z^2+d^2}} \end{gather}$$

which violates the boundary condition $\phi(x = 0, y, z) =$ const. 

The method of images suggests an easy solution by noticing the equivalence of this problem in the vacuum side $(x<0)$ to the same zone in the following problem. 

Namely in the auxiliary problem we have no surface at $x = 0$ but instead an opposite charge placed in the reflected point $\vec x = d \hat i$ we have:

$$\begin{gather} \phi(\vec x) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \left[\frac{q}{|\vec x + d\hat i|} - \frac{q}{|x-d\hat i|}\right]\end{gather}$$

and we notice that: 

It is generated by the same distribution of charges in the physical zone $(x < 0)$ 

It satisfies the BC at $x = 0$:

$$\begin{gather} \phi (x=0,y,z) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}q\left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{y^2+z^2+d^2}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{y^2+z^2+d^2}}\right] =0\end{gather}$$

Hence we conclude that this is the potential in the vacuum zone $x < 0$ of our problem. 

Let us use this solution to compute the [[Electric Field]] at the surface.

$$\begin{gather} \vec E(x = 0, y, z) = -\vec \nabla \phi\bigg|_{x=0,y,z} = -\hat i \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}\bigg|_{x = 0, y, z} =\frac{q}{2\pi \epsilon_0}\frac{d}{y^2+z^2}\hat i\end{gather}$$

i.e. the presence of the conducting wall at $x=0$ doubles the field magnitude at its vicinity. 

Since $\vec E = 0$ on the conductor side $(x < 0)$ we have: $$\begin{gather} [[\vec E]] \cdot \hat n = \frac{q}{2 \pi\epsilon_0}\frac{d}{y^2+z^2} = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \Rightarrow \\ \sigma(y,z) = \frac{q}{2\pi}\frac{d}{y^2+z^2} \end{gather}$$
