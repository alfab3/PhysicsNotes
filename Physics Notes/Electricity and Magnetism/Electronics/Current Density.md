## Definition 
In electromagnetism, current density is the amount of charge per unit time that flows through a unit area of chosen cross section. The current density vector is defined as a [[Vectors]] whose magnitude is the [[Electric Current]] per cross-sectional area at a given point in space, its direction being that of the positve charges at this point. In SI base units, the electric current density is measured in amperes per square meter
