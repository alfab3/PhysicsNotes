Kirchoff's circuit laws are two equalities that deal with the [[Electric Current]] and potential difference ([[Voltage]]) in the lumped element model of electrical circuits. 

## Kirchoff's Current Law
Also known as Kirchoff's first law, kirchoff's point rule, or Kirchoff's junction rule, states that for any node in an electrical circuit, the sum of [[Electric Current]], the sum of currents flowing into that node is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that node, or equivalently: 

The algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point is zero

Recalling that current is a signed quantity reflecting direction towards or away from a node, this principle can be stated as: 

$$\begin{gather} \sum^n_{k=1} I_k =0\end{gather}$$ where $n$ is the total number of branches with currents flowing towards or away from the node. The law is based on the [[Conservation of Charge]] where the [[Electric Charge]] is the product of current and time.

## Kirchoff's Voltage Law

This law, also called Kirchoff's second law, Kirchoff's second rule, or Kirchoff's loop rule, states the following: 

The directed sum of the potential difference around any closed loop is zero

Similarly to Kirchoff's current law, the voltage law can be stated as: 

$$\begin{gather} \sum^n_{k=1} V_k=0 \end{gather}$$

Here $n$ is the total number of voltages measured.
