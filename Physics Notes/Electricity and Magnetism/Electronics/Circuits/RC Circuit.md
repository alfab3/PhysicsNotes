A resistor-capacitor circuit or RC filter or RC network, is an electric circuit composed of resistors and capacitors. It may be driven by a [[Voltage]] or [[Electric Current]] source and these will produce different responses. A first order RC circuit is composed of one resistor and one capacitor and is the simplest type of RC circuit. 

RC circuits can be used to filter a signal by blocking certain frequencies and passing others. The two most common RC filters are the high pass and low pass filters.
