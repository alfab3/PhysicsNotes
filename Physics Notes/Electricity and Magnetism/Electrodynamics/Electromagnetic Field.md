## Definition
An electromagnetic field is a classical field produced by accelerating [[Electric Charge]]s. It is the field described by classical electrodynamics and is the classical counterpart to the [[Quantized Electromagnetic Field Tensor]] in [[Quantum Electrodynamics]]. The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light and interacts with charges and currents. Its quantum counterpart is one of of the four [[Fundamental Forces]] of nature. 

The field can be viewed as the combination of an [[Electric Field]] and a [[Magnetic Field]]. The electric field is produced by stationary charges, and the magnetic field by moving charges (currents); these two are often described as the sources of the field. The way in which charges and currents interact with the electromagnetic field is described by [[Maxwell's Equations]] and the [[Lorentz Force Law]]. The force created by the electric field is much stronger than the force created by the magnetic field.

From a classical perspective in the history of electromagnetism, the electromagnetic field can be regarded as a smooth continuous field propagated in a wavelike manner. By contrast, from the perspective of [[Quantum Field Theory]], this field is seen as quantized; meaning that the free quantum field can be expressed as the Fourier sum of creation and annihilation operators in energy momentum space while the effects of the interacting quantum field may be analyzed in [[Perturbation Theory]] via the [[S-matrix]] with the aid of a whole host mathematical technologies such as the [[Dyson Series]], [[Wick's Theorem]], [[Correlation Functions]], [[Time-Evolution Operators]], [[Feynman Diagrams]], etc. Note the quantized field is spatially continuous; its energy states however are discrete (the field's energy states must not be confused with its energy values, which are continuous; the quantum field's [[Creation Operator]]s create multiple discrete states of energy called [[Photons]])
