## Definition
An equation describing the magnetic field generated by a constant electric current. 

## Electric Currents 
The Biot-Savart law is used for computing the resultant magnetic field $\mathbf B$ at position $\mathbf r$ in 3D space generated by a flexible [[Current]] $I$. A steady (or stationary) current is a continual flow of charges which does not change with time and the charge neither accumulates nor depletes at any point. The law is a physical example of a line integral, being evaluated over the path $C$ in which the electric currents flow, the equation in [[SI Units]]:

$$\begin{gather} \mathbf B(\mathbf r) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \int_C\frac{I d\mathbf l \times \hat{\mathbf{r}'}}{|\mathbf r'|^2}\end{gather}$$

## Electric Current Density 
If the conductor is thick:

$$\begin{gather} \mathbf B(\mathbf r) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\iiint\frac{(\mathbf J dV) \times \mathbf r'}{|\mathbf r'|^3} \end{gather}$$
