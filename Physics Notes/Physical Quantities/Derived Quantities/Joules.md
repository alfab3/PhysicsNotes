The derived unit of energy ([[Classical Mechanics/Conservation Laws/Energy]]) in SI. It is equal to the amount of [[Work]] done when a force of 1 [[Newton]] displaces a mass through a distance of 1 [[Meter]] in the direction of force applied. 

Defined as:

$$\begin{gather} J = \frac{kg\cdot m^2}{s^2} = N \cdot m = W \cdot s = C\cdot V \end{gather}$$
