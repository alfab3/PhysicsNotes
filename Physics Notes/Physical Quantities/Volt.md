The derived unit for [[Electric Potential]], [[Electric Potential Difference]], and [[Electromotive Force]].

# Definition 
One volt is defined as the electric potential between two points of a conducting wire when an [[Electric Current]] of one [[Ampere]] dissipates one [[Watt]] of [[Power]] between those points. Equivalently, it is the potential difference between two points that will impart one [[Joules]] of [[Energy]] per [[Coulomb]] of charge that passes through it. It can be expressed in terms of SI base units as:

$$\begin{gather} V =\frac{\text{potential energy}}{\text{charge}} = \frac{J}{C} = \frac{kg \cdot m^2\cdot s^{-2}}{A \cdot s}\end{gather}$$

It can also be expressed as amperes times [[Ohm]]s.
