An electric current is a stream of charged particles, such as electrons or ions, moving through an electrical conductor or space. It is measured as the net rate of flow of electric charge through a surface or into a control volume. 

The SI unit of electric current is the ampere or amp which is the flow of electric charge across a surface at the rate of one Coulomb per second.
