Length is a measure of distance. In SI the basic Unit is the meter. 

Length is commonly understood to mean the most extended dimension of a fixed object. However this is not always the case. Various terms for the length of a fixed object are used, and these include height, width, breadthm or depth.

Length is the measure of one spatial [[Dimension]], whereas [[Area]] is a measure of two dimensions (length squared) and [[Volume]] is a measure of three dimensions (length cubed).
