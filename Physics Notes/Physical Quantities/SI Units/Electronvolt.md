# Definition
In physics, an electronvolt is the measure of an amount of [[Classical Mechanics/Newtonian Dynamics/Kinetic Energy]] gained by a single [[Electrons]] accelerating from rest through an [[Electric Potential Difference]] of one [[Volt]] in vacuum. When used as a unit of energy, the numerical value of 1 eV in [[Joules]] is equivalent to the numerical value of the charge of an electron in [[Coulombs]]. 

Under the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units

$$\begin{gather} 1 \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} J \end{gather}$$

Historically, the electronvolt was devised as a standard unit of measure through its usefulness in electrostatic particle accelerator sciences, because a particle with [[Electric Charge]] $q$ has an energy $E=qV$ after passing through the potential $V$; if $q$ is quoted in integer units of the elementary charge and the potential in volts, one gets an energy in $eV$. 

## Momentum
In high energy physics, the electronvolt is often used as a unit of [[Classical Mechanics/Conservation Laws/Momentum]].
