The Avogadro constant is the proportionality factor that relates the number of constituent particles (usual molecules, atoms or ions) in a sample with the amount of substance in that sample. Its SI unit is the reciprocal [[Mole]], and it is defined exactly as $$\begin{gather} N_A = 6.02214076 \times 10^{23} \end{gather}$$
