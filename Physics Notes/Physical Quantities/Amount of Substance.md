Amount of substance in a given sample of matter is defined as the number of discrete atomic-scale particles in it divided by the Avogadro constant $N_A$. In a truly atomistic view, the amount of substance is simply the number of particles that constitute the substance. The particles or entities may be molecules, atoms, ions, electrons, or other, depending on the context.
