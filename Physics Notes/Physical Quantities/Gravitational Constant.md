An emprical physical constant involved in the calculation of gravitational effects in Sir Isaac Newton's law of Universal Gravitatrion and in Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.

The value is defined as $$\begin{align} G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}\end{align}$$
