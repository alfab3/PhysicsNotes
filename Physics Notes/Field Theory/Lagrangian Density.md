In field theory, the independent variable is replaced by an event in [[spacetime]] $(x, y, z, t)$, or more generally still by a point s on a Riemannian Manifold, The dependent variables (q) are replaced by the value of a field at that point in spacetime $\phi(x,y,z,t)$ so that the [[Equations of Motion]] are ontained by means of an [[Action]] principle, written as 
$$
\frac{\delta S}{\delta \phi_i}=0
$$
where the action, $S$ is a [[Functional]] of the dependent variables $\phi_i(s)$, their derivatives and $s$ itself

$$
S[\phi_i] = \int L(\phi_i(s),\{\frac{\partial \phi_i (s)}{\partial s^{\alpha}}\}, \{s^\alpha\})d^n s
