Normal modes can be excited by applying a small external perturbation. We will confine ourselves with the case when such a perturbation corresponds to a time dependent generalized external potential term: 
$$\begin{align} L \rightarrow L - U_{ext}(t,\{q\}) \end{align}$$

Since the normal oscillations imply the limit of small amplitudes, the potential $U_{ext}$ should be Taylor expanded up to the first non-trivial terms about the position of equilibrium $\{q^{(0)}\}$: 
$$\begin{align} U_{ext}(t,\{q\}) \rightarrow U_{ext}(t,\{q^{(0)}\}) - \vec f(t) \cdot \vec x\end{align}$$

where: 
$$\begin{align} f_\alpha(t) = -\frac{\partial U_{ext}(t,\{q\})}{\partial q_\alpha}  \;\;\;\; (\text{at} \{q\}= \{q^{(0)}\}\end{align}$$

can be interpreted as the generalized force acting on the variable $x_\alpha$. The first term in the r.h.s is trivial - just a function of time. We omit it from now on.

We obtain the Lagrangian for the [[Normal Modes]] 
$$\begin{align} \mathcal L = \sum_s\left[\dot \eta _ 2^2/2 - \omega_s^2 \eta^2_s/2 + f_s(t) \eta_s\right] \end{align}$$

where $$\begin{align} f_s(t) = \vec f(t) \cdot \vec u_s \end{align}$$
