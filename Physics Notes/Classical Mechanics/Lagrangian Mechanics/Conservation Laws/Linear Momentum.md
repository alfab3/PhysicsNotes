Consider the [[Lagrangian]] of the system of interacting particles. It is invariant with respect to translation of all radius-vectors by one and the same vector. Let us take an infinitesimally small vector $\vec{\epsilon}$ and perform the transformation

$$\begin{align} \vec{r}_j\rightarrow \vec{r}_j + \vec{\epsilon}\end{align}$$

The conserved quantity is the linear momentum of the system: 
$$\begin{align} \sum^N_{j=1}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{r}_j} = \sum^N_{j=1}m_j\dot{\vec{r}}_j = \vec{P}  \end{align}$$
