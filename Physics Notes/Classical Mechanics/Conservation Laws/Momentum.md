Summing up all the $N$ equations [[Force Newtonian Dynamics]] and taking it account Newton's third law we get
$$
\frac{d}{dt}\sum_{i=1}^N m_i\vec{v}_i = \sum_{i,j}F_{ij}=\sum_{i,j} F_{ji} = -\sum_{i,j}F_{ij} = 0
$$
This means that the vector 
$$
\vec{P}=\sum^N_{i=1}m_i\vec{v_i}
$$
called the total momentum does not change in time. Apart from the total momentum, it is convenient to define the momentum of particle $i$ by $\vec{p_i} = m_i\vec{v_i}$; the total momentum of a system is then a sum of the momenta of all its particles.

Center of Mass 
The conservation of linear momentum has the following important consequence. For a special collective variable called the center of mass and defined as
$$
R = \frac{\sum^N_{i=1}m_i\vec{r_i}}{\sum^N_{i=1}m_i}
$$
The equation of motion decouple from the rest of variables and reads:
$$
\ddot{R} = 0
$$
meaning that the center of mass of an isolated system always moves with a constant velocity
