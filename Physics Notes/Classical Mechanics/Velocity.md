$S(t) \equiv \{\vec{r_i}(t), \vec{v_i}(t)\}, \; i =1,2,3,...,N$ where $\vec{v_i}$ stands for the [[Derivative]] of $\vec{r_i}$ with respect to time: $$ \vec{v}_i(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\vec{r_i}(t) \equiv \dot{\vec{r_i}}(t)$$

The quantity $\vec{v_i}(t)$ is called the  velocity of the $i-th$ particle at the time $t$.
