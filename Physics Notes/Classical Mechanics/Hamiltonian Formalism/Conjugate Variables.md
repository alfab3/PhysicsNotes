Conjugate variables are pairs of variables mathematically defined in such a way that they become [[Fourier Transform]] [[Dual]]s. The duality relations lead naturally to an uncertainty relation - in physics called the [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]] between them. Also conjugates variables are related by [[Math Methods/Calculus of Variations/Noether's Theorem]], which states that if the laws of physics are invariant with respect to a change in one of the conjugate variables, then the other conjugate variable will not change with time (it will be conserved).

Examples: 
Time and frequency 
Derivatives of [[Action]]

In QM conjugate variables are realized as pairs of observables whose operators do not commute.
