There is a special and quite important subclass of the Hamiltonian classical-field theories in which a classical complex-valued [[Scalar Field]] $\psi(\vec r)$ is a [[Complex Canonical Variables]]. In a direct analogy with the complex Hamilton's equations with the parameter $\lambda$ set equal to unity by appropriately rescaling the canonical variables the equation of motion reads
$$\begin{gather} i\dot\psi(\vec r) = \frac{\delta H[\psi,\psi^*]}{\delta \psi^*(\vec r)} \end{gather}$$

The Hamiltonian ([[Hamiltonian Function and Hamilton's Equations]]) is a real valued functional of the field $\psi$. Note that from the very form of this equation it is clear that we are dealing with a special case of Hamiltonian field theory, since the equation of motion for $\psi(\vec r)$ is always first order in terms of the time derivatives.

Similar to differentiation of complex variables: (See: [[Complex Canonical Variables]]), the variational derivatives with respect to a complex-valued function are defined with respect to its real and imaginary parts. Accordingly, with respect to the operations $\delta/\delta\psi(\vec r)$ and $\delta/\delta\psi^*(\vec r)$ the fields $\psi(\vec r)$ and $\psi^*(\vec r)$formally behave as independent ones. 


In the case of the classical field theory, the global U(1) symmetry of the Hamiltonian is defined as invariance with respect to the transformation $\psi(\vec r) \to \psi(\vec r)e^{i\phi}$; the word global here means that the phase $\phi$ is independent of $\vec r$. If global U(1) symmetry takes place then the amount of matter 
$$\begin{gather} N =\int |\psi|^2 d^d r \end{gather}$$

is conserved: 

$$\begin{gather} \dot N = 0 \end{gather}$$
