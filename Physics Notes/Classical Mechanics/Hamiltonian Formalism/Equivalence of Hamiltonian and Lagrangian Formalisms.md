Let us prove the equivalence of Hamiltonian ([[Hamiltonian Function and Hamilton's Equations]]) and [[Lagrangian Mechanics]]. Let $(H\{q,p\})$ be the Hamiltonian function of a certain system. Now consider the following three equivalent - the same up to a total derivative - Lagrangians:

$$\begin{gather} L(\{q,p,\dot q\}) = \sum_j p_j \dot q_j - H(\{q,p\})\\L(\{q,p,\dot p\}) = -\sum_j q_j\dot p_j - H(\{q,p\}) \\L(\{q,p,\dot q, \dot p\}) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_j(p_j\dot q _j - q_j\dot p_j) - H(\{q,p\})\end{gather}$$

In the context of these [[Lagrangian]]s, we formally treat coordinates and momenta as absolutely independent [[Generalized Coordinates]]. It is then straightforward to see that the [[Euler-Lagrange Equation]]s in this case are nothing but the Hamilton's equations for the for the Hamiltonian $H(\{q,p\})$
