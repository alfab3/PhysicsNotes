Consider the Hamiltonian:

$$\begin{gather} H(q,p)  = A\frac{q^2}{2}+B\frac{p^2}{2}\end{gather}$$

where $(q,p)$ is a canonical pair. Introducing a complex variable $a$  we produce: $H(a,a^*)$ of the form:

$$\begin{gather}H(a,a^*) = \xi|a|^2 + \nu a^2+\nu^*(a^*)^2 \end{gather}$$

 where $\xi$ and $\nu$ are certain quadratic expressions in terms of $\alpha, \alpha^*,\beta,\beta^*$ Let us use our freedom of choosing $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to get rid of the terms $\nu a^2$ and $\nu^*(a^*)^2$. From the explicit expression for $\nu$ we can see that we need to satisfy the condition $$\begin{gather} \alpha/\beta = \sqrt{A/B} \end{gather}$$
 
 in which case we get $\nu = 0$
