The complex form of Hamiltonian Mechanics ([[Hamiltonian Function and Hamilton's Equations]])  is especially convenient in the case when the Hamiltonian function $H(\{a,a^*\})$ is invariant under the transformation: 

$$\begin{gather} a_j \rightarrow a_je^{i\phi} \end{gather}$$ applied to a certain set of [[Complex Canonical Variables]]; the phase $\phi$ being one and the same for each member of the group. Such a symmetry is called U(1) symmetry. If the minimal U(1)-symmetric set of variables actually includes all the variables, we are dealing with the global U(1) symmetry.

For each set of U(1) symmetric variables, the quadratic form: 

$$\begin{gather} N = \sum_j|a_j|^2 \end{gather}$$

the summation is over the variables of a given U(1) symmetric set is a constant of motion:

$$\begin{gather} \dot N = 0\end{gather}$$


$$\begin{gather}\psi(\vec r) \rightarrow \psi(\vec r)e^{i\phi} \leftrightarrow a_k \rightarrow a_ke^{i\phi}
\\\int|\psi|^2d\vec r = \text{const}\end{gather}$$

From Classical to quantum:  $a^* \rightarrow \hat a^+_k$ and $a \rightarrow \hat a_k$
