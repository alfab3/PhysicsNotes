Work is the Energy ([[Classical Mechanics/Conservation Laws/Energy]]) transferred to or from an object via the application of force along a displacement. In its simplest form it is often represented as the product of force and displacement. 

$$\begin{gather} W = \int_C \vec F\cdot d\vec s \end{gather}$$
