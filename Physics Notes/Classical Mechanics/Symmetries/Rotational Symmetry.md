The idea of rotational symmetry is very close to that of translational symmetry.
It is the invariance with respect to rotation of all the coordinates around some axis. We
take some solution fri(t)g of the problem (2), (4), (5) and construct a new set of functions, $\{\vec{r_i}'(t)\}$,by rotating all radius vectors around some fixed axis by one and the same angle. The rotational symmetry means that $\{\vec{r_i}'(t)\}$ satisfies (2), (4), (5)
