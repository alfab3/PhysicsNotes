Center of Mass 
The conservation of linear [[Classical Mechanics/Conservation Laws/Momentum]] has the following important consequence. For a special collective variable called the center of mass and defined as
$$
R = \frac{\sum^N_{i=1}m_i\vec{r_i}}{\sum^N_{i=1}m_i}
$$
The equation of motion decouple from the rest of variables and reads:
$$
\ddot{R} = 0
$$
meaning that the center of mass of an isolated system always moves with a constant [[Velocity]]
