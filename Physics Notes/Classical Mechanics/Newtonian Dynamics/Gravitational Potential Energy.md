The potential energy a massive object has in relation to another massive object due to gravity. It is [[Potential Energy]] associated with the gravitational field, which is released when the objects fall towards each other. Gravitational potential energy increases when two objects are brought further apart.

For two pairwise interacting point particles, the gravitational potential energy $U$ is given by 
$$\begin{align} U = - \frac{GMm}{R}\end{align}$$ 
where $M$ and $m$ are the masses of the two partices, $R$ is the distance between them, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.
