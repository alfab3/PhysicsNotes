By the time-translation symmetry one means the invariance with respect to the transformation: 
$$\begin{align} t \rightarrow t + t_0 \end{align}$$
That is if we take some solution $\{\vec{r}_i(t)\}$ of [[Newtonian Dynamics Basic Postulates]] and costruct a new set of functions $\{\vec{r}_i'(t)\}$ such that
$$\begin{align}\vec{r}_i'(t) = \vec{r}_i(t - t_0)\  \end{align}$$
then this set of functions will also be a solution of the problem.
