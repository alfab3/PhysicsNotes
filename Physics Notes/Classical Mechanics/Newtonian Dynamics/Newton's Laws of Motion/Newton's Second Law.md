The rate of change of [[Classical Mechanics/Conservation Laws/Momentum]] of a body over time is directly proportional to the force applied, and occurs in the same direction as the applied force
$$
\vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}
$$
Constant [[Mass]]
For objects and systems with constant mass, the second law can be re-stated in terms of an objects [[Acceleration]]
$$
F=\frac{d(m\vec{v})}{dt}= m\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}=m\vec{a}
$$
