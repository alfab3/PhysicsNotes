Example of the interaction potential
$$
U_{ij}=\frac{\gamma_{ij}}{r}
$$
with the parameter $\gamma_{ij}$ depending on the properties of the two particles. The force corresponding to this potential is 
$$
\vec{F_{ij}} = \gamma_{ij}\frac{\vec{r}}{r^3}
$$
The absolute value of the force decays as $1/r^2$ with the interparticle distance. This example covers two fundamental forces: the coulomb force between two electrically charged particles and the gravitational force. In the former case, $\gamma_{ij}$ is the product of the electric charges of the two particles, while in the latter case it is minus the product of the two masses times the gravitational constant.
