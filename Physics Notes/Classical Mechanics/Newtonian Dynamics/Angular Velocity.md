Angular or rotational velocity, also known as angular frequency vector, is a vector measure of [[Rotation]] rate that refers to how fast an object rotates or revolves relative to to another point

## Particle in two dimensions

The simplest case of circular motion with radius $r$, with position given by the angular displacement $\phi(t)$ from the x-axis, the orbital angular velocity is the rate of change of angle with respect to time: 

$$\begin{gather} \omega = \frac{d\phi}{dt} \end{gather}$$

If $\phi$ is measured in [[Radians]], the arc length from the positive x-axis around the circle to the particle is $l=r\phi$ and the linear [[Velocity]] $$\begin{gather} v(t)=\frac{dl}{dt}=r\omega(t)\end{gather}$$

so that $$\begin{gather} \omega = \frac{v}{r}\end{gather}$$
