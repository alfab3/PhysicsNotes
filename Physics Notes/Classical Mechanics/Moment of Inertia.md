Defined as the product of [[Mass]] of section and the square of the distance between the reference axis and the centroid of the section.

Moment of Intertia $I$ is definef as the ratio of the net angular momentum $L$ of a system to its angular velocity $\omega$ around a principal axis, that is $I = \frac{L}{\omega}$
