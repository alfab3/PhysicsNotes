Describe the behavior of a physical system in terms of its motion as a function of time. More specifically, the equations of motion describe the behavior of a physical system as a set of mathematical functions in tems of dynamic variables. These variables are ususally spatial coordinates and time, but that may include momentum components. The most general choice are [[Generalized Coordinates]] which can be convenient variables characteristic of the physical system. The functions are defined in [[Euclidean Space]] is classical mechanics ([[CM Basic Postulates]]) but are replaced by [[Curved Spaces]] in relativity. If the dynamics of a system is known, the equations are the solutions for the differential equations describing the motion of the dynamics. 

There are two main descriptions of motion: dynamics and kinematics. Dynamics is general, since the momenta, forces and energy of the particles are taken into account. 

However kinematics is simpler. It concerns only variables derived from the positions of objects and time. 

Equations of motion can therefore be grouped under these main classifiers of motion. In all cases, the main types of motion are [[Translation]], [[Rotation]], [[Oscillation]] or any combinations of these. 

Fomally, in general an equation of Motion $M$ is a function of the [[Position]] $\vec{r}$ of the object, the first time [[Derivative]] of $\vec{r}$:  $\vec{x}$ and its acceleration, the second time derivative of $\vec{r}$: $\vec{a}$, and time t.
