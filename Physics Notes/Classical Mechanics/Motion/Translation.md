In Classical Mechanics ([[CM Basic Postulates]]), translational motion is movement that changes the position of an object

A translation is the operation changing the positions of all points $(x,y,z)$ of an object according to the formula 
$$
(x, y, z) \rightarrow (x+\Delta x, y + \Delta y, z + \Delta z)
$$
where  $(\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z)$ is the same vector for each point of the object. The translation vector$(\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z)$ common to all points of the object describes a particular type of displacement of the object, usually called a linear displacement to distinguich from displacements involving roation, called angular displacements.
