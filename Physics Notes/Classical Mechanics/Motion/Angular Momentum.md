The quantity 
$$
\vec{L}=\sum^N_{i=1} \vec{r_i} \times \vec{p_i}
$$
is called total angular momentum of the system (with respect to the origin of the coordinates). We can also introduce the individual angular momentum for each particle, $\vec{l_i} = \vec{r_i} \times \vec{p_i}$, so that $\vec{L} = \sum^N_{i=1} \vec{l_i}$
