A central force on an object is a force that is directed towards or away from a point celled the center of force.
$$\begin{align} \vec{F} = \vec{F}(\vec{r})=|F(r)|\hat{r}\end{align}$$

Central forces that are conservative can always be expressed as the negative [[Gradient]] of a [[Potential Energy]]. 

$$\begin{align} \vec{F}(\vec{r}) = - \nabla V(\vec{r})\end{align}$$
