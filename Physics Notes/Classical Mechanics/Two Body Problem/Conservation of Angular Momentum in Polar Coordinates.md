In polar coordinates, the law of conservation of the angular momentum reads
$$\begin{align}
	\dot{\theta} = \frac{l}{mr^2} \; \; \; \;
	(l = |\vec{L}|=const)
\end{align}
$$
From the [[Angular Momentum]] equation we see that the angular velocity $\dot{\theta}$ does not change its sign, so that the particle permanently rotates around the center in one and the same direction, dependings on the the initial condition. We also see that the case $l = 0$ is special: Here $\theta = const$ (no rotation) and the motion is one-dimensional.
